00:00:34,183 --&gt; 00:00:35,582<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Michael.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>4<br/>
00:00:35,751 --&gt; 00:00:38,686<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Dear Michael. Of course it's you.<br/>
Who else could they send?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>5<br/>
00:00:38,854 --&gt; 00:00:40,185<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Who else could be trusted?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>6<br/>
00:00:40,356 --&gt; 00:00:43,086<br/>
&lt;i&gt;And I know it's a long way<br/>
and you're ready to go to work.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>7<br/>
00:00:43,259 --&gt; 00:00:46,558<br/>
&lt;i&gt;All I'm saying is wait, just wait, just...
Just please hear me out.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>8<br/>
00:00:46,729 --&gt; 00:00:49,926<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Because this is not an episode,<br/>
relapse, fuckup.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>9<br/>
00:00:50,099 --&gt; 00:00:52,659<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I'm begging you, Michael,<br/>
I'm begging you.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>10<br/>
00:00:52,835 --&gt; 00:00:55,668<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Try and make believe<br/>
this is not just madness...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>11<br/>
00:00:55,838 --&gt; 00:00:58,864<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... because this is not just madness.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>12<br/>
00:00:59,208 --&gt; 00:01:01,472<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Two weeks ago,<br/>
I came out of the building, okay?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>13<br/>
00:01:01,644 --&gt; 00:01:04,169<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I'm running across 6th Avenue,<br/>
there's a car waiting...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>14<br/>
00:01:04,346 --&gt; 00:01:07,543<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... I got exactly 38 minutes to get<br/>
to the airport, and I'm dictating.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>15<br/>
00:01:07,716 --&gt; 00:01:10,480<br/>
&lt;i&gt;There's this panicked associate<br/>
sprinting along beside me...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>16<br/>
00:01:10,653 --&gt; 00:01:13,178<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... scribbling in a notepad,<br/>
and she starts screaming.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>17<br/>
00:01:13,355 --&gt; 00:01:16,290<br/>
&lt;i&gt;And I realize we're standing<br/>
in the middle of the street...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>18<br/>
00:01:16,458 --&gt; 00:01:20,451<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... the light's changed and there's this wall
of serious traffic speeding towards us.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>19<br/>
00:01:20,629 --&gt; 00:01:22,654<br/>
&lt;i&gt;And I freeze. I can't move.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>20<br/>
00:01:22,831 --&gt; 00:01:25,459<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I'm suddenly consumed<br/>
with the overwhelming sensation...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>21<br/>
00:01:25,634 --&gt; 00:01:27,659<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... that I'm covered<br/>
with some <span style="background-color: #41A317"> sort of</span> film.&lt;/i&gt;  
</p><p>22<br/>
00:01:27,836 --&gt; 00:01:32,432<br/>
&lt;i&gt;And it's in my hair, in my face.<br/>
And it's like a glaze, like a coating.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>23<br/>
00:01:32,608 --&gt; 00:01:35,372<br/>
&lt;i&gt;And at first I thought,<br/>
"Oh, my God, I know what this is.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>24<br/>
00:01:35,544 --&gt; 00:01:37,978<br/>
&lt;i&gt;This is some <span style="background-color: #41A317"> sort of</span> amniotic,  (形容詞    羊膜的)<br/>
embryonic (胚芽的; 胎兒的) fluid.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>25<br/>
00:01:38,147 --&gt; 00:01:39,842<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I'm drenched in afterbirth.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>26<br/>
00:01:40,015 --&gt; 00:01:42,677<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I've breached the chrysalis.<br/>
I've been reborn. "&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>27<br/>
00:01:42,851 --&gt; 00:01:46,150<br/>
&lt;i&gt;But then, the traffic, the stampede,
the cars, the trucks, the horns...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>28<br/>
00:01:46,322 --&gt; 00:01:50,349<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... this poor woman screaming,<br/>
and I'm thinking, "No. This is not rebirth.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>29<br/>
00:01:50,526 --&gt; 00:01:53,393<br/>
&lt;i&gt;This is some kind of giddy illusion<br/>
of renewal...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>30<br/>
00:01:53,562 --&gt; 00:01:56,326<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... that happens in<br/>
the final moment before death. "&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>31<br/>
00:01:56,498 --&gt; 00:02:00,093<br/>
&lt;i&gt;And then I realize,<br/>
"No, no, no, this is completely wrong"...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>32<br/>
00:02:00,269 --&gt; 00:02:03,238<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... because I looked back<br/>
at the building...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>33<br/>
00:02:03,405 --&gt; 00:02:06,033<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... and I had the most stunning<br/>
moment of clarity.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>34<br/>
00:02:06,208 --&gt; 00:02:08,301<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I realized, Michael...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>35<br/>
00:02:08,477 --&gt; 00:02:12,504<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... that I had emerged, not through<br/>
the doors of Kenner, Bach &amp; Ledeen...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>36<br/>
00:02:12,681 --&gt; 00:02:15,980<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... not through the portals<br/>
of our vast and powerful law firm...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>37<br/>
00:02:16,151 --&gt; 00:02:18,949<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... but from the asshole of an organism...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>38<br/>
00:02:19,121 --&gt; 00:02:23,751<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... whose sole function is<br/>
to excrete the poison...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>39<br/>
00:02:23,926 --&gt; 00:02:27,293<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... the ammo, the defoliant necessary
for other larger...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>40<br/>
00:02:27,463 --&gt; 00:02:31,024<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... more powerful organisms<br/>
to destroy the miracle of humanity.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>41<br/>
00:02:31,200 --&gt; 00:02:35,068<br/>
&lt;i&gt;And that I had been coated<br/>
in this patina of shit...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>42<br/>
00:02:35,237 --&gt; 00:02:37,432<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... for the best part of my life.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>43<br/>
00:02:37,606 --&gt; 00:02:41,440<br/>
&lt;i&gt;And the stench of it, the stain of it
would take the rest of my life to undo.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>44<br/>
00:02:41,610 --&gt; 00:02:42,872<br/>
&lt;i&gt;And you know what I did?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>45<br/>
00:02:43,045 --&gt; 00:02:46,776<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I took a deep, cleansing breath<br/>
and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>46<br/>
00:02:46,949 --&gt; 00:02:51,352<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I said to myself, "As clear as this may be,
as potent a feeling as this is...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>47<br/>
00:02:51,520 --&gt; 00:02:55,718<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... as true a thing as I believe<br/>
that I have witnessed today, it must wait.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>48<br/>
00:02:55,891 --&gt; 00:02:58,359<br/>
&lt;i&gt;It must stand the test of time. "&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>49<br/>
00:02:58,527 --&gt; 00:03:01,553<br/>
&lt;i&gt;And, Michael, the time is now.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>50<br/>
00:03:04,133 --&gt; 00:03:07,034<br/>
I'm not sure what else I can tell you<br/>
that I haven't already.
</p><p>51<br/>
00:03:07,202 --&gt; 00:03:09,727<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Tell me about U/North, Barry.<br/>
They're your clients.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>52<br/>
00:03:09,905 --&gt; 00:03:14,137<br/>
&lt;i&gt;So you tell me why you're settling<br/>
a six-year-old case on the fly at midnight.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>53<br/>
00:03:14,309 --&gt; 00:03:17,005<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Because I'm writing this story<br/>
whether you like it or not.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>54<br/>
00:03:17,179 --&gt; 00:03:18,510<br/>
What does that exactly mean?
</p><p>55<br/>
00:03:18,681 --&gt; 00:03:21,081<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Give me something I can print.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>56<br/>
00:03:28,090 --&gt; 00:03:29,853<br/>
We found 97.
</p><p>57<br/>
00:03:36,432 --&gt; 00:03:39,560<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I've got that cunt from<br/>
The Wall Street Journal on my cell phone.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>58<br/>
00:03:39,735 --&gt; 00:03:41,896<br/>
She will not go away.
</p><p>59<br/>
00:03:45,374 --&gt; 00:03:46,864<br/>
Marty Bach. How can I help you?
</p><p>60<br/>
00:03:47,042 --&gt; 00:03:50,136<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Marty, hi. It's Bridget Klein.<br/>
We're going with a story tomorrow...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>61<br/>
00:03:50,312 --&gt; 00:03:53,543<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... about a settlement in the U/North
defoliant case. You wanna comment?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>62<br/>
00:03:53,716 --&gt; 00:03:57,083<br/>
Case you're referring to is now,<br/>
as it has been for the past six years...
</p><p>63<br/>
00:03:57,252 --&gt; 00:03:59,117<br/>
...pending and unresolved.
</p><p>64<br/>
00:03:59,288 --&gt; 00:04:01,882<br/>
Till such time as our client<br/>
has their day in court...
</p><p>65<br/>
00:04:02,057 --&gt; 00:04:05,549<br/>
...or the plaintiffs drop the suit,<br/>
I'll have nothing of value to tell you.
</p><p>66<br/>
00:04:05,728 --&gt; 00:04:08,788<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Come on, Marty, you're closing<br/>
the U/North case. You're settling.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>67<br/>
00:04:08,964 --&gt; 00:04:13,424<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I know that. I know you're up there with
600 people jamming this thing through.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>68<br/>
00:04:13,602 --&gt; 00:04:16,036<br/>
Here's what I know.<br/>
Your deadline was 20 minutes ago.
</p><p>69<br/>
00:04:16,205 --&gt; 00:04:19,697<br/>
So you're fishing for a story or<br/>
trying to get out of writing a retraction.
</p><p>70<br/>
00:04:19,875 --&gt; 00:04:22,366<br/>
In either case,<br/>
I wish you the best of luck.
</p><p>71<br/>
00:04:23,479 --&gt; 00:04:25,504<br/>
Where the fuck is Karen Crowder?
</p><p>72<br/>
00:05:14,496 --&gt; 00:05:15,986<br/>
I'll see the turn.
</p><p>73<br/>
00:05:22,004 --&gt; 00:05:23,528<br/>
Check.
</p><p>74<br/>
00:05:25,040 --&gt; 00:05:26,302<br/>
Check.
</p><p>75<br/>
00:05:26,675 --&gt; 00:05:28,040<br/>
Check.
</p><p>76<br/>
00:05:28,210 --&gt; 00:05:30,201<br/>
Half the pot. Two hundred.
</p><p>77<br/>
00:05:30,379 --&gt; 00:05:32,074<br/>
Two hundred to go.
</p><p>78<br/>
00:05:43,192 --&gt; 00:05:44,454<br/>
You don't remember me, huh?
</p><p>79<br/>
00:05:45,828 --&gt; 00:05:47,955<br/>
We played together a couple times.
</p><p>80<br/>
00:05:48,130 --&gt; 00:05:50,223<br/>
That lamp place on Bowery.
</p><p>81<br/>
00:05:50,399 --&gt; 00:05:53,061<br/>
That guy's showroom?<br/>
All the lamps and shit?
</p><p>82<br/>
00:05:53,669 --&gt; 00:05:55,637<br/>
- The Galaxy.<br/>
- That's it.
</p><p>83<br/>
00:05:55,804 --&gt; 00:05:59,001<br/>
You had a restaurant<br/>
you were opening, right?
</p><p>84<br/>
00:05:59,174 --&gt; 00:06:02,405<br/>
My old partner bid that job,<br/>
the plumbing.
</p><p>85<br/>
00:06:03,111 --&gt; 00:06:05,978<br/>
- You don't remember me?<br/>
- I remember you.
</p><p>86<br/>
00:06:06,148 --&gt; 00:06:08,412<br/>
Because I lost a lot of weight since then.
</p><p>87<br/>
00:06:09,151 --&gt; 00:06:10,914<br/>
You bought some hair too.
</p><p>88<br/>
00:06:11,587 --&gt; 00:06:13,384<br/>
With your money.
</p><p>89<br/>
00:06:14,423 --&gt; 00:06:16,653<br/>
So, what happened with the bar?
</p><p>90<br/>
00:06:16,825 --&gt; 00:06:18,588<br/>
You just had to be a rock star, huh?
</p><p>91<br/>
00:06:18,760 --&gt; 00:06:22,924<br/>
Shit, man. I want to listen to Larry King,
I go home and put the fucking TV on.
</p><p>92<br/>
00:06:23,098 --&gt; 00:06:25,566<br/>
That was a good location.
</p><p>93<br/>
00:06:25,734 --&gt; 00:06:28,567<br/>
Yeah, that's what my partner<br/>
kept telling me.
</p><p>94<br/>
00:06:29,104 --&gt; 00:06:30,537<br/>
Action's on you.
</p><p>95<br/>
00:06:31,173 --&gt; 00:06:32,936<br/>
I bet the pot.
</p><p>96<br/>
00:06:35,677 --&gt; 00:06:37,508<br/>
Good to see you again.
</p><p>97<br/>
00:07:10,312 --&gt; 00:07:11,301<br/>
Hello?
</p><p>98<br/>
00:07:11,480 --&gt; 00:07:12,742<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- Michael.<br/>
- Walter.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>99<br/>
00:07:12,915 --&gt; 00:07:16,146<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Michael, thank God, there you are.<br/>
Look, I got a situation.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>100<br/>
00:07:16,318 --&gt; 00:07:20,414<br/>
&lt;i&gt;A big problem, all right? A client of mine,
he just called, he hit a guy with his car.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>101<br/>
00:07:20,589 --&gt; 00:07:22,489<br/>
&lt;i&gt;He thinks he did. He thinks he hit him.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>102<br/>
00:07:22,658 --&gt; 00:07:23,647<br/>
Just now?
</p><p>103<br/>
00:07:23,825 --&gt; 00:07:26,487<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Yeah, just now. Ten, 15 minutes ago.
He's driving home.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>104<br/>
00:07:26,662 --&gt; 00:07:28,721<br/>
&lt;i&gt;He's home now. He's there waiting.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>105<br/>
00:07:28,897 --&gt; 00:07:30,057<br/>
Where?
</p><p>106<br/>
00:07:30,232 --&gt; 00:07:34,066<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Westchester. I'm down here in Bermuda.
He just got me up. I'm half asleep here.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>107<br/>
00:07:34,236 --&gt; 00:07:35,260<br/>
Is he drunk?
</p><p>108<br/>
00:07:35,437 --&gt; 00:07:38,304<br/>
&lt;i&gt;No. It's the first thing I asked him.
He's good, he's sober.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>109<br/>
00:07:38,473 --&gt; 00:07:39,963<br/>
Tell him to stay off the phone.
</p><p>110<br/>
00:07:40,142 --&gt; 00:07:42,406<br/>
&lt;i&gt;All right. But you're on it?<br/>
You can get up there?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>111<br/>
00:07:42,577 --&gt; 00:07:44,340<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Because this guy, he's a huge client.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>112<br/>
00:07:44,913 --&gt; 00:07:47,074<br/>
&lt;i&gt;This is half my book, this guy, okay?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>113<br/>
00:07:47,249 --&gt; 00:07:48,682<br/>
I'm walking to the car now.
</p><p>114<br/>
00:07:48,850 --&gt; 00:07:52,217<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Okay. Look, look, let me call him right back
and I'll get the address.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>115<br/>
00:07:52,387 --&gt; 00:07:55,982<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Just let me know you're on the way,<br/>
and I'll get back to you with the details.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>116<br/>
00:07:56,158 --&gt; 00:07:57,591<br/>
All right. I'll be in the car.
</p><p>117<br/>
00:08:51,680 --&gt; 00:08:53,944<br/>
&lt;i&gt;What they did, see,<br/>
they changed the grade there.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>118<br/>
00:08:54,116 --&gt; 00:08:55,913<br/>
They widened the street.
</p><p>119<br/>
00:08:56,084 --&gt; 00:08:58,985<br/>
I'm sure somebody told them<br/>
that that was an improvement.
</p><p>120<br/>
00:08:59,154 --&gt; 00:09:03,648<br/>
But now, you see, when it rains and when
there is fog, and with this new angle...
</p><p>121<br/>
00:09:03,825 --&gt; 00:09:07,420<br/>
...and they've got these new...<br/>
These... These...
</p><p>122<br/>
00:09:07,596 --&gt; 00:09:09,689<br/>
These sodium lamps, it's blinding.
</p><p>123<br/>
00:09:09,865 --&gt; 00:09:13,130<br/>
- That corner there. It is blinding.<br/>
- They'll have to work that out.
</p><p>124<br/>
00:09:13,301 --&gt; 00:09:16,134<br/>
And it's not just tonight.<br/>
I've been saying this for years.
</p><p>125<br/>
00:09:16,304 --&gt; 00:09:20,934<br/>
I mean, how many times have we talked<br/>
about that corner? Dell?
</p><p>126<br/>
00:09:21,109 --&gt; 00:09:23,373<br/>
Mr. Greer, we don't have<br/>
a lot of time here.
</p><p>127<br/>
00:09:23,545 --&gt; 00:09:28,482<br/>
So the circumstances, the road conditions,
none of this holds any interest for you?
</p><p>128<br/>
00:09:28,650 --&gt; 00:09:31,551<br/>
What interests me is finding<br/>
the strongest criminal attorney...
</p><p>129<br/>
00:09:31,720 --&gt; 00:09:33,312<br/>
...that can be here in 15 minutes.
</p><p>130<br/>
00:09:33,889 --&gt; 00:09:36,722<br/>
Well, that sounds ominous.
</p><p>131<br/>
00:09:36,892 --&gt; 00:09:39,452<br/>
We have some good relationships<br/>
up here in Westchester.
</p><p>132<br/>
00:09:39,628 --&gt; 00:09:42,563<br/>
So, what are you? What are you?<br/>
You're not a lawyer?
</p><p>133<br/>
00:09:42,731 --&gt; 00:09:44,528<br/>
- Not the kind you need.<br/>
- What kind is that?
</p><p>134<br/>
00:09:44,699 --&gt; 00:09:45,688<br/>
A trial lawyer.
</p><p>135<br/>
00:09:46,068 --&gt; 00:09:48,730<br/>
Somebody who can see this through.<br/>
That's not what I do.
</p><p>136<br/>
00:09:48,904 --&gt; 00:09:52,465<br/>
Okay. I think we're gonna have to<br/>
pull Walter back in on this.
</p><p>137<br/>
00:09:52,641 --&gt; 00:09:55,633<br/>
I wanna get Walter back on the phone,<br/>
get him back into the mix.
</p><p>138<br/>
00:09:55,811 --&gt; 00:09:59,542<br/>
Because, I'll be frank with you,<br/>
I don't like the way this is going.
</p><p>139<br/>
00:09:59,714 --&gt; 00:10:03,377<br/>
Sir, we don't have time for Walter.<br/>
Your options are gonna get smaller quickly.
</p><p>140<br/>
00:10:03,552 --&gt; 00:10:05,611<br/>
What options?<br/>
I'm not hearing any options!
</p><p>141<br/>
00:10:05,787 --&gt; 00:10:07,015<br/>
I suggest you go local...
</p><p>142<br/>
00:10:07,189 --&gt; 00:10:10,056<br/>
...and I'm telling you there are<br/>
people here I like for this.
</p><p>143<br/>
00:10:10,225 --&gt; 00:10:12,284<br/>
Great. That's it?<br/>
That's what you got for me?
</p><p>144<br/>
00:10:12,461 --&gt; 00:10:14,486<br/>
Hey, you believe this?
</p><p>145<br/>
00:10:14,663 --&gt; 00:10:16,961<br/>
I have been a client at Kenner, Bach<br/>
for 12 years!
</p><p>146<br/>
00:10:17,132 --&gt; 00:10:20,863<br/>
You think I paid that retainer every month
for a place at the back of the line?
</p><p>147<br/>
00:10:21,036 --&gt; 00:10:24,335<br/>
Mr. Greer, you left the scene of an accident
on a slow weeknight...
</p><p>148<br/>
00:10:24,506 --&gt; 00:10:26,701<br/>
...six miles from<br/>
the state police barracks.
</p><p>149<br/>
00:10:26,875 --&gt; 00:10:29,105<br/>
If there's a line,<br/>
you're right up front.
</p><p>150<br/>
00:10:29,277 --&gt; 00:10:32,144<br/>
I can get a lawyer any time I want.<br/>
I don't need you for that.
</p><p>151<br/>
00:10:32,314 --&gt; 00:10:36,216<br/>
We're not sitting here for 45 minutes<br/>
waiting for a goddamn referral!
</p><p>152<br/>
00:10:36,384 --&gt; 00:10:38,147<br/>
I don't know what Walter<br/>
promised you...
</p><p>153<br/>
00:10:38,320 --&gt; 00:10:41,778<br/>
A miracle worker! That's Walter<br/>
on the phone, 20 minutes ago.
</p><p>154<br/>
00:10:41,957 --&gt; 00:10:45,051<br/>
Direct quote, okay? "Hang tight.<br/>
I'm sending you a miracle worker."
</p><p>155<br/>
00:10:45,227 --&gt; 00:10:46,854<br/>
- Well, he misspoke.<br/>
- About what?
</p><p>156<br/>
00:10:47,028 --&gt; 00:10:49,622<br/>
That you're the firm's fixer?<br/>
Or that you're good at it?
</p><p>157<br/>
00:10:49,798 --&gt; 00:10:51,265<br/>
Elliot.
</p><p>158<br/>
00:10:51,666 --&gt; 00:10:54,726<br/>
The guy was running! In the street!
</p><p>159<br/>
00:10:54,903 --&gt; 00:10:59,636<br/>
You take that, you add the fog,<br/>
you add the lamps, you add the angle...
</p><p>160<br/>
00:11:01,143 --&gt; 00:11:04,635<br/>
What the fuck is he doing running in<br/>
the middle of the street at midnight?!
</p><p>161<br/>
00:11:04,813 --&gt; 00:11:07,008<br/>
You answer me that!
</p><p>162<br/>
00:11:20,328 --&gt; 00:11:22,728<br/>
What if someone had stolen the car?
</p><p>163<br/>
00:11:25,834 --&gt; 00:11:27,062<br/>
Happens all the time.
</p><p>164<br/>
00:11:27,235 --&gt; 00:11:29,328<br/>
Cops like hit-and-runs.
</p><p>165<br/>
00:11:29,504 --&gt; 00:11:31,529<br/>
They work them hard,<br/>
they clear them fast.
</p><p>166<br/>
00:11:31,706 --&gt; 00:11:34,903<br/>
Right now there's a B.C.I. Unit<br/>
pulling paint chips off a guard rail.
</p><p>167<br/>
00:11:35,076 --&gt; 00:11:38,409<br/>
Tomorrow, they're gonna be looking<br/>
for the owner of a custom-painted...
</p><p>168<br/>
00:11:38,580 --&gt; 00:11:40,810<br/>
...hand-rubbed Jaguar XJ-12.
</p><p>169<br/>
00:11:40,982 --&gt; 00:11:42,574<br/>
And the guy you hit?
</p><p>170<br/>
00:11:42,751 --&gt; 00:11:46,118<br/>
If he got a look at the plates,<br/>
it won't even take that long.
</p><p>171<br/>
00:11:49,324 --&gt; 00:11:51,053<br/>
There's no play here.
</p><p>172<br/>
00:11:51,860 --&gt; 00:11:54,192<br/>
There's no angle.<br/>
There's no champagne room.
</p><p>173<br/>
00:11:54,362 --&gt; 00:11:57,024<br/>
I'm not a miracle worker, I'm a janitor.
</p><p>174<br/>
00:11:57,699 --&gt; 00:11:59,257<br/>
The math on this is simple.
</p><p>175<br/>
00:11:59,434 --&gt; 00:12:02,426<br/>
The smaller the mess,<br/>
the easier it is for me to clean up.
</p><p>176<br/>
00:12:03,572 --&gt; 00:12:07,702<br/>
That's the police, isn't it?
</p><p>177<br/>
00:12:07,876 --&gt; 00:12:09,275<br/>
No.
</p><p>178<br/>
00:12:10,111 --&gt; 00:12:11,772<br/>
They don't call.
</p><p>179<br/>
00:12:16,518 --&gt; 00:12:17,883<br/>
Hello.
</p><p>180<br/>
00:12:18,954 --&gt; 00:12:21,252<br/>
Jerry, it's Michael Clayton.
</p><p>181<br/>
00:12:21,423 --&gt; 00:12:23,891<br/>
Yeah, look, I'm sorry to wake you up.
</p><p>182<br/>
00:12:24,226 --&gt; 00:12:26,956<br/>
No. I'm in the neighborhood.
</p><p>183<br/>
00:12:27,896 --&gt; 00:12:29,193<br/>
You got a pen?
</p><p>184<br/>
00:16:11,686 --&gt; 00:16:13,779<br/>
Mom, where's my cards?
</p><p>185<br/>
00:16:18,827 --&gt; 00:16:20,658<br/>
Where's my cards?
</p><p>186<br/>
00:16:34,876 --&gt; 00:16:36,207<br/>
Is my other deck in here?
</p><p>187<br/>
00:16:36,377 --&gt; 00:16:37,776<br/>
Did you eat?
</p><p>188<br/>
00:16:37,946 --&gt; 00:16:39,846<br/>
Dad's down there waiting already.
</p><p>189<br/>
00:16:40,014 --&gt; 00:16:41,879<br/>
There were cards in our bathroom.
</p><p>190<br/>
00:16:42,050 --&gt; 00:16:43,312<br/>
Yes, I had a waffle.
</p><p>191<br/>
00:16:43,485 --&gt; 00:16:46,352<br/>
Since we're out of waffles,<br/>
I don't see how that's possible.
</p><p>192<br/>
00:16:46,521 --&gt; 00:16:47,852<br/>
It's a miracle.
</p><p>193<br/>
00:16:51,626 --&gt; 00:16:53,150<br/>
Gloves?
</p><p>194<br/>
00:16:59,968 --&gt; 00:17:00,957<br/>
Henry!
</p><p>195<br/>
00:17:05,740 --&gt; 00:17:07,139<br/>
Come on.
</p><p>196<br/>
00:17:09,143 --&gt; 00:17:10,474<br/>
Get in.
</p><p>197<br/>
00:17:12,747 --&gt; 00:17:14,078<br/>
Got it?
</p><p>198<br/>
00:17:19,921 --&gt; 00:17:22,481<br/>
&lt;i&gt;So no one's even sure<br/>
exactly where they are...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>199<br/>
00:17:22,657 --&gt; 00:17:25,820<br/>
...because there's no borders<br/>
or landmarks or anything.
</p><p>200<br/>
00:17:25,994 --&gt; 00:17:28,724<br/>
And the town?<br/>
It's not even a town really.
</p><p>201<br/>
00:17:28,897 --&gt; 00:17:32,094<br/>
It just is this camp where all these people
have gathered to hide.
</p><p>202<br/>
00:17:32,267 --&gt; 00:17:33,256<br/>
Right.
</p><p>203<br/>
00:17:33,434 --&gt; 00:17:36,892<br/>
All these deserters and guys<br/>
that got cut off from their armies.
</p><p>204<br/>
00:17:37,071 --&gt; 00:17:40,234<br/>
All these people that are hiding<br/>
in the woods, trying to stay alive.
</p><p>205<br/>
00:17:40,408 --&gt; 00:17:42,308<br/>
This is where they all came.
</p><p>206<br/>
00:17:42,477 --&gt; 00:17:45,469<br/>
There's Thieves, Gray Mages,<br/>
Unbidden Warriors...
</p><p>207<br/>
00:17:45,647 --&gt; 00:17:47,672<br/>
...Dark Avians,<br/>
Riverwynders and Sappers.
</p><p>208<br/>
00:17:47,849 --&gt; 00:17:51,012<br/>
- There's, like, 15 different characters, okay?
- Okay.
</p><p>209<br/>
00:17:51,486 --&gt; 00:17:53,215<br/>
And nobody has any alliances.
</p><p>210<br/>
00:17:53,388 --&gt; 00:17:56,653<br/>
You can't even say who you are<br/>
because, you don't know...
</p><p>211<br/>
00:17:56,824 --&gt; 00:17:58,815<br/>
...maybe the person you're talking to...
</p><p>212<br/>
00:17:58,993 --&gt; 00:18:01,484<br/>
...maybe they're like your mortal enemy
in the wars.
</p><p>213<br/>
00:18:01,663 --&gt; 00:18:04,359<br/>
So it's just completely like<br/>
everybody for themselves.
</p><p>214<br/>
00:18:04,532 --&gt; 00:18:05,863<br/>
Sounds familiar.
</p><p>215<br/>
00:18:06,034 --&gt; 00:18:08,969<br/>
It's really good.<br/>
I'm serious, you should really read it.
</p><p>216<br/>
00:18:09,137 --&gt; 00:18:12,300<br/>
Right. But by the time I finish it,<br/>
you'll be on to something else.
</p><p>217<br/>
00:18:12,473 --&gt; 00:18:15,237<br/>
- How much you wanna bet?<br/>
- I don't know. How much you got?
</p><p>218<br/>
00:18:15,977 --&gt; 00:18:18,241<br/>
- You got your bus pass?<br/>
- It's in my locker.
</p><p>219<br/>
00:18:18,413 --&gt; 00:18:21,280<br/>
You're not even gonna look at it,<br/>
are you?
</p><p>220<br/>
00:18:21,449 --&gt; 00:18:22,882<br/>
- The book?<br/>
- Yes.
</p><p>221<br/>
00:18:23,051 --&gt; 00:18:24,450<br/>
Bring it on Saturday, I'll...
</p><p>222<br/>
00:18:24,619 --&gt; 00:18:27,850<br/>
I did already. I left it in your kitchen.
It's got a red cover.
</p><p>223<br/>
00:18:28,022 --&gt; 00:18:29,148<br/>
Okay.
</p><p>224<br/>
00:18:29,324 --&gt; 00:18:31,724<br/>
Well, here we go.
</p><p>225<br/>
00:18:31,893 --&gt; 00:18:34,589<br/>
Go. Teach these people something,<br/>
would you?
</p><p>226<br/>
00:18:38,700 --&gt; 00:18:41,225<br/>
- See you later, Dad.<br/>
- Yeah, kiddo.
</p><p>227<br/>
00:18:43,338 --&gt; 00:18:44,771<br/>
Thanks.
</p><p>228<br/>
00:18:51,045 --&gt; 00:18:54,572<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Lot 52, lot of assorted mixing bowls,
assorted sizes.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>229<br/>
00:18:54,749 --&gt; 00:18:57,718<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Thirty dollars to start. Thirty dollars.
Thirty dollars I have.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>230<br/>
00:18:57,885 --&gt; 00:19:00,979<br/>
You can get me to 40. I got 40. And 50.
Sixty dollars back there.
</p><p>231<br/>
00:19:01,155 --&gt; 00:19:03,385<br/>
Sixty dollars, get me to 70.<br/>
I got 70 dollars.
</p><p>232<br/>
00:19:03,558 --&gt; 00:19:06,083<br/>
Seventy dollars, I have now, 70.<br/>
Eighty dollars there.
</p><p>233<br/>
00:19:06,260 --&gt; 00:19:08,660<br/>
Eighty dollars, this gentleman here.<br/>
Eighty dollars.
</p><p>234<br/>
00:19:08,830 --&gt; 00:19:11,560<br/>
Ninety dollars there. Give me 100.<br/>
One hundred I have now.
</p><p>235<br/>
00:19:23,177 --&gt; 00:19:25,475<br/>
He says you're still gonna be short.
</p><p>236<br/>
00:19:27,849 --&gt; 00:19:29,373<br/>
How short?
</p><p>237<br/>
00:19:29,550 --&gt; 00:19:32,951<br/>
Sixty. Plus the points, 75 thousand.
</p><p>238<br/>
00:19:33,121 --&gt; 00:19:36,181<br/>
- That's liquor and everything?<br/>
- What'd you think it was gonna be?
</p><p>239<br/>
00:19:36,357 --&gt; 00:19:39,349<br/>
I don't know. Less. Thirty. Twenty.
</p><p>240<br/>
00:19:39,527 --&gt; 00:19:43,395<br/>
He took 1500 on a refrigerator<br/>
I paid four grand for.
</p><p>241<br/>
00:19:43,564 --&gt; 00:19:45,191<br/>
Make a bid.
</p><p>242<br/>
00:19:46,934 --&gt; 00:19:49,425<br/>
Are you telling me you don't have<br/>
the 75 thousand?
</p><p>243<br/>
00:19:49,604 --&gt; 00:19:51,663<br/>
Just lying around, no.
</p><p>244<br/>
00:19:53,741 --&gt; 00:19:56,266<br/>
We both know it's your brother<br/>
I should be talking to.
</p><p>245<br/>
00:19:56,444 --&gt; 00:19:57,468<br/>
Forget that.
</p><p>246<br/>
00:19:57,645 --&gt; 00:20:01,945<br/>
Michael, look, you wanna front this,<br/>
that's up to you.
</p><p>247<br/>
00:20:02,116 --&gt; 00:20:05,347<br/>
But Timmy's name stays in the book<br/>
till we're clear.
</p><p>248<br/>
00:20:05,820 --&gt; 00:20:10,120<br/>
If I know where he is,<br/>
I don't have to keep asking.
</p><p>249<br/>
00:20:10,291 --&gt; 00:20:13,988<br/>
He's upstate. His wife took him back.<br/>
I don't know where he is.
</p><p>250<br/>
00:20:14,162 --&gt; 00:20:15,959<br/>
He's gotta have something.
</p><p>251<br/>
00:20:16,130 --&gt; 00:20:17,620<br/>
He's got the two kids with her.
</p><p>252<br/>
00:20:17,799 --&gt; 00:20:21,462<br/>
He's got Jennifer, the coke-dealing waitress
that he knocked up.
</p><p>253<br/>
00:20:21,636 --&gt; 00:20:26,300<br/>
He's got four Michelin radials<br/>
that he stole from my sister's garage.
</p><p>254<br/>
00:20:27,608 --&gt; 00:20:29,371<br/>
Make an offer.
</p><p>255<br/>
00:20:31,846 --&gt; 00:20:36,180<br/>
I had a wife who was a drunk.<br/>
She was a beautiful girl, young girl.
</p><p>256<br/>
00:20:36,350 --&gt; 00:20:40,912<br/>
But live like that? Even they do a program...
She did, I think, once, two years.
</p><p>257<br/>
00:20:41,089 --&gt; 00:20:43,080<br/>
And then they slip? Forget it.
</p><p>258<br/>
00:20:43,257 --&gt; 00:20:45,623<br/>
It's like you're strapped to a bomb.
</p><p>259<br/>
00:20:46,627 --&gt; 00:20:48,788<br/>
What's my timeframe here?
</p><p>260<br/>
00:20:49,597 --&gt; 00:20:51,121<br/>
I don't know.
</p><p>261<br/>
00:20:51,299 --&gt; 00:20:53,290<br/>
I didn't think it'd be a problem.
</p><p>262<br/>
00:20:54,936 --&gt; 00:20:56,426<br/>
I'll ask.
</p><p>263<br/>
00:21:23,965 --&gt; 00:21:26,160<br/>
- Hey, Michael.<br/>
- Morning, Carl.
</p><p>264<br/>
00:21:34,408 --&gt; 00:21:37,673<br/>
I don't know. Del, I don't know<br/>
how hard you want me to press here.
</p><p>265<br/>
00:21:37,845 --&gt; 00:21:39,836<br/>
Let me know how brave he wants to be.
</p><p>266<br/>
00:21:40,014 --&gt; 00:21:42,346<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Well, I'm not sure how brave<br/>
he can be right now.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>267<br/>
00:21:42,517 --&gt; 00:21:44,849<br/>
&lt;i&gt;We just got a confirmation hearing<br/>
scheduled.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>268<br/>
00:21:45,019 --&gt; 00:21:46,418<br/>
Any chance she knows that?
</p><p>269<br/>
00:21:46,587 --&gt; 00:21:50,216<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Well, it was in the paper. Who knows?
Maybe she got someone to read it to her.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>270<br/>
00:21:50,391 --&gt; 00:21:52,916<br/>
&lt;i&gt;She called his wife yesterday.<br/>
She's calling his house.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>271<br/>
00:21:53,094 --&gt; 00:21:54,322<br/>
&lt;i&gt;This is a total nightmare.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>272<br/>
00:21:54,495 --&gt; 00:21:56,622<br/>
Well, my guess is<br/>
she's gonna want the condo.
</p><p>273<br/>
00:21:56,798 --&gt; 00:21:57,856<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Come on, that's insane.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>274<br/>
00:21:58,032 --&gt; 00:22:01,559<br/>
Well, what can I tell you?<br/>
Don't piss off a motivated stripper.
</p><p>275<br/>
00:22:01,736 --&gt; 00:22:02,930<br/>
&lt;i&gt;It's just unbelievable.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>276<br/>
00:22:03,104 --&gt; 00:22:06,369<br/>
All right. Well, find out his pain threshold
and get back to me.
</p><p>277<br/>
00:22:06,541 --&gt; 00:22:08,441<br/>
Or you can tell him to call me directly.
</p><p>278<br/>
00:22:08,609 --&gt; 00:22:10,600<br/>
&lt;i&gt;All right, I hear you. Let me get into it.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>279<br/>
00:22:10,778 --&gt; 00:22:11,938<br/>
Thanks.
</p><p>280<br/>
00:22:12,113 --&gt; 00:22:13,740<br/>
Hey, where are we with Marty?
</p><p>281<br/>
00:22:14,749 --&gt; 00:22:16,239<br/>
We left word.
</p><p>282<br/>
00:22:16,417 --&gt; 00:22:18,578<br/>
Hold on. Go back. How old is the kid?
</p><p>283<br/>
00:22:18,753 --&gt; 00:22:20,744<br/>
&lt;i&gt;He's not a kid. He's 22.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>284<br/>
00:22:20,922 --&gt; 00:22:22,583<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- This is Miami?<br/>
- Nope. Key Biscayne.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>285<br/>
00:22:22,757 --&gt; 00:22:24,247<br/>
And they charged him.
</p><p>286<br/>
00:22:24,425 --&gt; 00:22:27,724<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Reckless endangerment. My client...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>287<br/>
00:22:27,895 --&gt; 00:22:33,333<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I think really what they want, they want
a reality check on the attorney down there.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>288<br/>
00:22:33,501 --&gt; 00:22:35,560<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- Yeah.<br/>
- Wayne said you have some connections?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>289<br/>
00:22:35,736 --&gt; 00:22:38,261<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- Yeah, let me get a pen.<br/>
- Thank you.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>290<br/>
00:22:39,040 --&gt; 00:22:42,066<br/>
Now, if she calls the INS directly,<br/>
she's gonna get nowhere.
</p><p>291<br/>
00:22:42,243 --&gt; 00:22:43,471<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Even with the appointment?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>292<br/>
00:22:43,644 --&gt; 00:22:46,135<br/>
It's retail, Evan.<br/>
It's like the DMV over there.
</p><p>293<br/>
00:22:46,314 --&gt; 00:22:49,647<br/>
Unless they get a call from<br/>
a district supervisor, then nobody moves.
</p><p>294<br/>
00:22:49,817 --&gt; 00:22:51,375<br/>
&lt;i&gt;But your guy can do that?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>295<br/>
00:22:51,552 --&gt; 00:22:52,883<br/>
He's a former commissioner.
</p><p>296<br/>
00:22:53,054 --&gt; 00:22:55,989<br/>
&lt;i&gt;None of this comes back to me?<br/>
Because that doesn't do any good.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>297<br/>
00:22:56,157 --&gt; 00:22:58,250<br/>
No, look, I'm gonna be<br/>
the one that's asking.
</p><p>298<br/>
00:22:58,426 --&gt; 00:23:00,758<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- Can you hang on a minute?<br/>
- Yeah, sure.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>299<br/>
00:23:02,563 --&gt; 00:23:03,860<br/>
Are we merging?
</p><p>300<br/>
00:23:04,832 --&gt; 00:23:06,527<br/>
Marty Bach's in London.
</p><p>301<br/>
00:23:06,701 --&gt; 00:23:09,795<br/>
They said he was in Atlanta,<br/>
then Lara said he was in the building.
</p><p>302<br/>
00:23:09,971 --&gt; 00:23:12,098<br/>
So I called back.<br/>
I know you want this meeting.
</p><p>303<br/>
00:23:12,273 --&gt; 00:23:14,833<br/>
Now she tells me the truth.<br/>
He's really in London.
</p><p>304<br/>
00:23:15,009 --&gt; 00:23:18,206<br/>
So are we merging?<br/>
I mean, that's what everyone's saying.
</p><p>305<br/>
00:23:18,379 --&gt; 00:23:20,506<br/>
All these Brits?<br/>
That this time it's for real.
</p><p>306<br/>
00:23:20,681 --&gt; 00:23:22,478<br/>
Like I would know.
</p><p>307<br/>
00:23:23,117 --&gt; 00:23:24,345<br/>
I don't know.
</p><p>308<br/>
00:23:24,518 --&gt; 00:23:28,181<br/>
But even if we are, I mean, even if<br/>
they merged, it wouldn't affect us, right?
</p><p>309<br/>
00:23:28,956 --&gt; 00:23:30,617<br/>
Your phone's ringing.
</p><p>310<br/>
00:23:31,492 --&gt; 00:23:32,959<br/>
Evan?
</p><p>311<br/>
00:23:33,728 --&gt; 00:23:36,492<br/>
Hey. Okay, here's what I'll do.
</p><p>312<br/>
00:23:36,664 --&gt; 00:23:39,633<br/>
Let me give him a call<br/>
and set up a meeting for next week.
</p><p>313<br/>
00:23:39,800 --&gt; 00:23:42,200<br/>
I'll walk her in,<br/>
I'll make the introduction...
</p><p>314<br/>
00:23:42,370 --&gt; 00:23:45,931<br/>
&lt;i&gt;At the moment,<br/>
U/North currently has 70,000 employees...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>315<br/>
00:23:46,107 --&gt; 00:23:49,133<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... in 62 countries around the world.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>316<br/>
00:23:50,711 --&gt; 00:23:52,338<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Around the planet.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>317<br/>
00:23:53,481 --&gt; 00:23:57,212<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Operating in 62 countries<br/>
around the planet.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>318<br/>
00:23:58,319 --&gt; 00:24:03,052<br/>
At work in more than 60 countries<br/>
around the globe.
</p><p>319<br/>
00:24:05,459 --&gt; 00:24:08,895<br/>
We have... We have, right now...<br/>
We have...
</p><p>320<br/>
00:24:09,063 --&gt; 00:24:12,294<br/>
At U/North right now,<br/>
we've got 75,000 employees...
</p><p>321<br/>
00:24:12,466 --&gt; 00:24:15,230<br/>
...in over 60 countries around the planet.
</p><p>322<br/>
00:24:15,403 --&gt; 00:24:18,167<br/>
We are a very successful<br/>
and highly diversified company...
</p><p>323<br/>
00:24:18,339 --&gt; 00:24:20,068<br/>
...so you can imagine...
</p><p>324<br/>
00:24:20,241 --&gt; 00:24:23,677<br/>
...the volume and the variety<br/>
of legal issues we have to deal with is...
</p><p>325<br/>
00:24:23,844 --&gt; 00:24:25,311<br/>
Overwhelming.
</p><p>326<br/>
00:24:27,281 --&gt; 00:24:28,714<br/>
It's just enormous.
</p><p>327<br/>
00:24:29,216 --&gt; 00:24:32,515<br/>
So you can imagine,<br/>
the volume of legal issues...
</p><p>328<br/>
00:24:33,821 --&gt; 00:24:36,085<br/>
It's quite substantial.
</p><p>329<br/>
00:24:36,257 --&gt; 00:24:38,851<br/>
&lt;i&gt;And as general counsel, what I do...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>330<br/>
00:24:39,026 --&gt; 00:24:41,221<br/>
...what our in-house department does...
</p><p>331<br/>
00:24:41,395 --&gt; 00:24:46,662<br/>
...is to analyze the dimension<br/>
of the problem or the opportunity...
</p><p>332<br/>
00:24:46,834 --&gt; 00:24:49,166<br/>
...to determine the jurisdiction...
</p><p>333<br/>
00:24:49,337 --&gt; 00:24:51,567<br/>
...and to outsource our business...
</p><p>334<br/>
00:24:51,739 --&gt; 00:24:55,197<br/>
...to those firms and talents<br/>
that we think can help us the most.
</p><p>335<br/>
00:24:55,609 --&gt; 00:24:58,237<br/>
&lt;i&gt;So with all that pressure and workload...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>336<br/>
00:24:58,412 --&gt; 00:25:01,745<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... how do you keep a balance<br/>
between work and life?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>337<br/>
00:25:01,916 --&gt; 00:25:03,383<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Balance?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>338<br/>
00:25:05,953 --&gt; 00:25:09,218<br/>
I think that's... That's something that...
</p><p>339<br/>
00:25:09,390 --&gt; 00:25:12,723<br/>
...you search for your whole life, isn't it?
</p><p>340<br/>
00:25:12,893 --&gt; 00:25:15,691<br/>
It's a shifting balance, really.
</p><p>341<br/>
00:25:15,863 --&gt; 00:25:19,026<br/>
It's, you know, you... You try to...
</p><p>342<br/>
00:25:19,200 --&gt; 00:25:22,499<br/>
&lt;i&gt;When you really are enjoying<br/>
what it is you do...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>343<br/>
00:25:22,670 --&gt; 00:25:24,535<br/>
...who needs balance?
</p><p>344<br/>
00:25:25,639 --&gt; 00:25:28,130<br/>
There's your balance.<br/>
There's your balance.
</p><p>345<br/>
00:25:28,309 --&gt; 00:25:32,268<br/>
When you're really enjoying<br/>
what it is you do, there is your balance.
</p><p>346<br/>
00:25:32,446 --&gt; 00:25:34,607<br/>
When Don asked me to take...
</p><p>347<br/>
00:25:34,782 --&gt; 00:25:37,250<br/>
When Don Jeffries brought...<br/>
Don Jeffries brought me...
</p><p>348<br/>
00:25:37,418 --&gt; 00:25:40,387<br/>
Don Jeffries brought me in here<br/>
12 years ago...
</p><p>349<br/>
00:25:40,554 --&gt; 00:25:43,648<br/>
...trusted me, mentored me.
</p><p>350<br/>
00:25:43,824 --&gt; 00:25:46,793<br/>
Welcomed me into the U/North family.
</p><p>351<br/>
00:25:47,495 --&gt; 00:25:51,295<br/>
And when he moved up to the boardroom,<br/>
I never really...
</p><p>352<br/>
00:25:52,099 --&gt; 00:25:55,626<br/>
...dreamt that I would have<br/>
the opportunity to move into his position.
</p><p>353<br/>
00:25:55,803 --&gt; 00:25:58,567<br/>
But, is it challenging? Yes.
</p><p>354<br/>
00:25:58,739 --&gt; 00:26:04,405<br/>
And I think that it's possible that those
first few months were a little shaky.
</p><p>355<br/>
00:26:04,578 --&gt; 00:26:09,675<br/>
But then you realize that you've been<br/>
taught to be ready, and you take the helm.
</p><p>356<br/>
00:26:09,850 --&gt; 00:26:13,843<br/>
Because if you're not comfortable<br/>
with that level of responsibility...
</p><p>357<br/>
00:26:14,021 --&gt; 00:26:15,852<br/>
...you're in the wrong place.
</p><p>358<br/>
00:26:16,023 --&gt; 00:26:21,120<br/>
It's your department, your capacity to<br/>
make tough decisions in real time, and...
</p><p>359<br/>
00:26:21,962 --&gt; 00:26:23,725<br/>
We're in the middle of an interview.
</p><p>360<br/>
00:26:23,898 --&gt; 00:26:25,866<br/>
They said it was urgent.
</p><p>361<br/>
00:26:27,868 --&gt; 00:26:29,335<br/>
Jesus.
</p><p>362<br/>
00:26:30,037 --&gt; 00:26:31,834<br/>
For chrissake.
</p><p>363<br/>
00:26:33,407 --&gt; 00:26:35,272<br/>
You're saying he did this in...?
</p><p>364<br/>
00:26:35,443 --&gt; 00:26:36,501<br/>
Oh, my God.
</p><p>365<br/>
00:26:36,677 --&gt; 00:26:39,339<br/>
- Barry.<br/>
- Hang on.
</p><p>366<br/>
00:26:39,847 --&gt; 00:26:44,978<br/>
Arthur Edens just stripped down naked<br/>
in a deposition room in Milwaukee.
</p><p>367<br/>
00:26:46,987 --&gt; 00:26:48,318<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Oh, Michael...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>368<br/>
00:26:48,489 --&gt; 00:26:52,152<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... I took a deep, cleansing breath<br/>
and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>369<br/>
00:26:52,326 --&gt; 00:26:57,127<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I said to myself, "As clear as this may be,
as potent a feeling as this is...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>370<br/>
00:26:57,298 --&gt; 00:27:01,064<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... as true a thing as I believe<br/>
that I have witnessed today, it must wait.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>371<br/>
00:27:01,235 --&gt; 00:27:04,227<br/>
&lt;i&gt;It must stand the test of time. "&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>372<br/>
00:27:04,405 --&gt; 00:27:07,169<br/>
&lt;i&gt;And, Michael, the time is now.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>373<br/>
00:27:07,341 --&gt; 00:27:10,799<br/>
&lt;i&gt;This moment, today,<br/>
here, this room, this air...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>374<br/>
00:27:10,978 --&gt; 00:27:15,381<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... and this, especially this, Michael,
that you're here.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>375<br/>
00:27:15,549 --&gt; 00:27:17,346<br/>
&lt;i&gt;There's a reason.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>376<br/>
00:27:17,518 --&gt; 00:27:19,213<br/>
&lt;i&gt;A reason it's you, Michael.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>377<br/>
00:27:19,386 --&gt; 00:27:23,880<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Surely, you have some sense of that,
how it pulls together, how it gathers.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>378<br/>
00:27:24,058 --&gt; 00:27:27,789<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Nurse Michael, the secret hero,<br/>
the keeper of the hidden sins.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>379<br/>
00:27:27,962 --&gt; 00:27:30,226<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Tell me you can see that, Michael,<br/>
for God's sake.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>380<br/>
00:27:30,731 --&gt; 00:27:35,532<br/>
But, I mean, yeah, yes, yes.<br/>
The nudity, the parking lot, I admit it.
</p><p>381<br/>
00:27:35,703 --&gt; 00:27:39,400<br/>
It was... It was... It was a mistake.<br/>
It was wrong. It was lame.
</p><p>382<br/>
00:27:39,573 --&gt; 00:27:42,667<br/>
It was obvious. And therapeutically,<br/>
it was completely useless...
</p><p>383<br/>
00:27:42,843 --&gt; 00:27:46,210<br/>
...because I swear, I could stand here<br/>
and tear off my fucking skin...
</p><p>384<br/>
00:27:46,947 --&gt; 00:27:51,111<br/>
...and I could not get down<br/>
to where this thing is living.
</p><p>385<br/>
00:27:51,285 --&gt; 00:27:55,016<br/>
Six years, Michael.<br/>
Six years I've absorbed this poison.
</p><p>386<br/>
00:27:55,189 --&gt; 00:27:58,454<br/>
Four hundred depositions,<br/>
a hundred motions, five changes of venue...
</p><p>387<br/>
00:27:58,626 --&gt; 00:28:01,060<br/>
...85,000 documents in discovery.
</p><p>388<br/>
00:28:01,228 --&gt; 00:28:05,426<br/>
Six years of scheming and stalling<br/>
and screaming, and what have I got?
</p><p>389<br/>
00:28:05,599 --&gt; 00:28:10,059<br/>
I've spent 12 percent of my life defending
the reputation of a deadly weed killer!
</p><p>390<br/>
00:28:10,237 --&gt; 00:28:12,330<br/>
- We had an agreement, Arthur.<br/>
- One night.
</p><p>391<br/>
00:28:12,506 --&gt; 00:28:15,441<br/>
One night, right?<br/>
I look up and there's Marty in my office.
</p><p>392<br/>
00:28:15,609 --&gt; 00:28:16,940<br/>
He's got some champagne.
</p><p>393<br/>
00:28:17,111 --&gt; 00:28:21,878<br/>
He tells me we just hit 30,000 billable hours
on U/North and he wants to celebrate.
</p><p>394<br/>
00:28:22,049 --&gt; 00:28:25,576<br/>
So an hour later, I find myself<br/>
in a whorehouse in Chelsea...
</p><p>395<br/>
00:28:25,753 --&gt; 00:28:29,154<br/>
...with two Lithuanian redheads<br/>
taking turns sucking my dick.
</p><p>396<br/>
00:28:29,323 --&gt; 00:28:33,419<br/>
I'm laying there and I'm trying not<br/>
to come and I wanna...
</p><p>397<br/>
00:28:33,594 --&gt; 00:28:35,892<br/>
I wanna make it last,<br/>
so I start doing the math.
</p><p>398<br/>
00:28:36,063 --&gt; 00:28:39,294<br/>
I think, "Thirty thousand hours,<br/>
what is that? That's 24 times 30.
</p><p>399<br/>
00:28:39,466 --&gt; 00:28:44,563<br/>
That's 720 hours in a month,<br/>
8760 hours in a year..."
</p><p>400<br/>
00:28:44,738 --&gt; 00:28:46,296<br/>
- Arthur.<br/>
- No, wait, wait, wait!
</p><p>401<br/>
00:28:46,473 --&gt; 00:28:49,806<br/>
Because it's years! It's lives!
</p><p>402<br/>
00:28:49,977 --&gt; 00:28:52,810<br/>
And the numbers are making me dizzy<br/>
and, you know...
</p><p>403<br/>
00:28:52,980 --&gt; 00:28:57,178<br/>
...now, instead of trying not to come,<br/>
I'm trying not to think, and I can't stop.
</p><p>404<br/>
00:28:57,351 --&gt; 00:28:58,750<br/>
I mean, is this me?
</p><p>405<br/>
00:28:58,919 --&gt; 00:29:03,253<br/>
Am I this freak organism that has been<br/>
sent here to sleep and eat...
</p><p>406<br/>
00:29:03,424 --&gt; 00:29:07,622<br/>
...and defend this one horrific chain<br/>
of carcinogenic molecules?
</p><p>407<br/>
00:29:07,795 --&gt; 00:29:09,786<br/>
Is that my destiny? Is that my fate?
</p><p>408<br/>
00:29:09,964 --&gt; 00:29:12,194<br/>
- Listen, you promised me.<br/>
- Is that it, Michael?
</p><p>409<br/>
00:29:12,366 --&gt; 00:29:15,335<br/>
Is that my grail?<br/>
Two Lithuanian mouths on my cock?
</p><p>410<br/>
00:29:15,502 --&gt; 00:29:18,062<br/>
Is that the correct answer<br/>
to the multiple choice of me?
</p><p>411<br/>
00:29:18,239 --&gt; 00:29:21,436<br/>
You wanna go off your medication,<br/>
that's fine. But you call me first.
</p><p>412<br/>
00:29:21,609 --&gt; 00:29:23,270<br/>
- That was our agreement.<br/>
- Sue me.
</p><p>413<br/>
00:29:23,444 --&gt; 00:29:24,638<br/>
We okay in there?
</p><p>414<br/>
00:29:25,613 --&gt; 00:29:28,343<br/>
We're fine. We're fine.
</p><p>415<br/>
00:29:31,885 --&gt; 00:29:34,012<br/>
They killed them, Michael.
</p><p>416<br/>
00:29:34,188 --&gt; 00:29:37,385<br/>
Those small farms, the family farms.
</p><p>417<br/>
00:29:37,558 --&gt; 00:29:40,083<br/>
Did you...? Did you...?<br/>
Did you meet Anna?
</p><p>418<br/>
00:29:40,261 --&gt; 00:29:41,285<br/>
No.
</p><p>419<br/>
00:29:41,462 --&gt; 00:29:44,556<br/>
You gotta see her, you gotta talk to her.
She's a miracle, Michael.
</p><p>420<br/>
00:29:44,732 --&gt; 00:29:46,723<br/>
She's God's perfect little creature.
</p><p>421<br/>
00:29:46,900 --&gt; 00:29:50,336<br/>
And for 50 million dollars in fees,<br/>
I've spent 12 percent of my life...
</p><p>422<br/>
00:29:50,504 --&gt; 00:29:54,133<br/>
...destroying perfect Anna<br/>
and her dead parents and her dying brother.
</p><p>423<br/>
00:29:54,308 --&gt; 00:29:56,071<br/>
When did you last take one of these?
</p><p>424<br/>
00:29:56,243 --&gt; 00:29:58,973<br/>
No. I'm not losing this.<br/>
Everything is finally significant.
</p><p>425<br/>
00:29:59,146 --&gt; 00:30:01,580<br/>
The world is a beautiful place.<br/>
I'm not trading that.
</p><p>426<br/>
00:30:01,749 --&gt; 00:30:05,014<br/>
- If it's real, the pill won't kill it.
- I have blood on my hands.
</p><p>427<br/>
00:30:05,185 --&gt; 00:30:07,847<br/>
You are senior litigating partner<br/>
of one of the largest...
</p><p>428<br/>
00:30:08,022 --&gt; 00:30:10,718<br/>
...most respected law firms in the world.
You are a legend.
</p><p>429<br/>
00:30:10,891 --&gt; 00:30:13,223<br/>
- I'm an accomplice!<br/>
- You're a manic-depressive.
</p><p>430<br/>
00:30:13,727 --&gt; 00:30:16,696<br/>
I am Shiva, the god of death.
</p><p>431<br/>
00:30:17,097 --&gt; 00:30:20,089<br/>
Let's get out of Milwaukee,<br/>
we'll talk about it.
</p><p>432<br/>
00:30:21,568 --&gt; 00:30:26,232<br/>
&lt;i&gt;We came back from the hospital<br/>
and everybody was crying...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>433<br/>
00:30:26,407 --&gt; 00:30:30,434<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... and we were in shock, but we still...
We had to milk.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>434<br/>
00:30:30,611 --&gt; 00:30:33,045<br/>
&lt;i&gt;The cows won't wait, will they?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>435<br/>
00:30:33,213 --&gt; 00:30:34,202<br/>
&lt;i&gt;No.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>436<br/>
00:30:34,915 --&gt; 00:30:37,406<br/>
&lt;i&gt;And when you went to the barn?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>437<br/>
00:30:37,584 --&gt; 00:30:40,178<br/>
&lt;i&gt;We found the note. My sister found it.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>438<br/>
00:30:40,354 --&gt; 00:30:42,584<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- From your mother?<br/>
- Yes.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>439<br/>
00:30:42,756 --&gt; 00:30:44,747<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Could you read it for us, please?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>440<br/>
00:30:45,459 --&gt; 00:30:49,088<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Just read the third paragraph,<br/>
just the highlighted section there.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>441<br/>
00:30:49,830 --&gt; 00:30:52,526<br/>
&lt;i&gt;"I don't want you blaming Ned Hardy<br/>
or any of the people... "&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>442<br/>
00:30:52,700 --&gt; 00:30:53,928<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Anna.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>443<br/>
00:30:54,601 --&gt; 00:30:56,364<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- Anna.<br/>
- "Down at...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>444<br/>
00:30:56,537 --&gt; 00:30:58,198<br/>
&lt;i&gt;It's all right, Anna, go on.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>445<br/>
00:30:58,372 --&gt; 00:31:00,272<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- I'm just...<br/>
- Excuse me.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>446<br/>
00:31:00,441 --&gt; 00:31:02,534<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- Anna, they're...<br/>
- What's he doing?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>447<br/>
00:31:02,710 --&gt; 00:31:05,406<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Excuse me. She's a...<br/>
No, this is testimony. This is...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>448<br/>
00:31:05,579 --&gt; 00:31:07,570<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Excuse me, I have an objection.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>449<br/>
00:31:07,748 --&gt; 00:31:10,114<br/>
&lt;i&gt;You can be a witness here.<br/>
You can be a witness.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>450<br/>
00:31:10,284 --&gt; 00:31:11,979<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I am not a witness to this, sir, l...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>451<br/>
00:31:12,152 --&gt; 00:31:14,746<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Anna, I love you.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>452<br/>
00:31:14,922 --&gt; 00:31:19,825<br/>
&lt;i&gt;And I'm sitting here<br/>
and I'm listening to you and I swear...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>453<br/>
00:31:19,993 --&gt; 00:31:24,760<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... that I love you more than anything
in the world. And this is my moment.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>454<br/>
00:31:24,932 --&gt; 00:31:28,732<br/>
&lt;i&gt;This strange conference-table moment.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>455<br/>
00:31:28,902 --&gt; 00:31:30,802<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Turn off that camera!&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>456<br/>
00:31:31,372 --&gt; 00:31:34,864<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- This is my offering!<br/>
- No, I want this on the record!&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>457<br/>
00:31:35,042 --&gt; 00:31:36,270<br/>
&lt;i&gt;How do I turn it off?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>458<br/>
00:31:36,443 --&gt; 00:31:39,970<br/>
&lt;i&gt;This is my offering. My clothes are<br/>
my offering. This is my shame.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>459<br/>
00:31:40,147 --&gt; 00:31:42,911<br/>
&lt;i&gt;My credentials! I'm ashamed!&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>460<br/>
00:31:43,083 --&gt; 00:31:46,484<br/>
&lt;i&gt;And I love you, and I swear to God...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>461<br/>
00:31:54,194 --&gt; 00:31:55,752<br/>
I guess that's it.
</p><p>462<br/>
00:32:02,936 --&gt; 00:32:04,233<br/>
When do we get Don?
</p><p>463<br/>
00:32:04,838 --&gt; 00:32:07,363<br/>
She said to try back in half an hour.
</p><p>464<br/>
00:32:07,541 --&gt; 00:32:10,442<br/>
And how about the flights?<br/>
What's the story at O'Hare?
</p><p>465<br/>
00:32:11,678 --&gt; 00:32:14,306<br/>
- Closed four minutes ago.<br/>
- Shit.
</p><p>466<br/>
00:32:15,682 --&gt; 00:32:18,082<br/>
There is a foot of snow<br/>
in Detroit already.
</p><p>467<br/>
00:32:18,252 --&gt; 00:32:20,516<br/>
Todd, could I get that coffee now?
</p><p>468<br/>
00:32:22,723 --&gt; 00:32:26,853<br/>
Who is this guy they sent from New York?
Clayton? I never heard of him.
</p><p>469<br/>
00:32:28,662 --&gt; 00:32:30,095<br/>
Michael Raymond Clayton.
</p><p>470<br/>
00:32:30,264 --&gt; 00:32:35,167<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Born September 9, 1959,<br/>
St. Joseph's Hospital, Bronx, New York.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>471<br/>
00:32:35,335 --&gt; 00:32:39,032<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Father is NYPD patrolman<br/>
Raymond Xavier Clayton.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>472<br/>
00:32:39,206 --&gt; 00:32:41,868<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Mother, Alice Mary Clayton.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>473<br/>
00:32:42,042 --&gt; 00:32:45,205<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Graduates Washingtonville Central<br/>
High School, Orange County, New York...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>474<br/>
00:32:45,379 --&gt; 00:32:47,006<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... in 1977.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>475<br/>
00:32:47,181 --&gt; 00:32:51,550<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Graduates St. John's University, 1980.
Fordham Law, '82.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>476<br/>
00:32:52,219 --&gt; 00:32:56,713<br/>
&lt;i&gt;'82 through '86, he's ADA with<br/>
the Queens district attorney's office.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>477<br/>
00:32:56,890 --&gt; 00:32:59,825<br/>
&lt;i&gt;1986, he's with<br/>
the Joint Manhattan-Queens...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>478<br/>
00:32:59,993 --&gt; 00:33:01,927<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... Organized Crime Task Force.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>479<br/>
00:33:02,095 --&gt; 00:33:05,496<br/>
And then in 1990, he starts<br/>
at Kenner, Bach &amp; Ledeen.
</p><p>480<br/>
00:33:05,666 --&gt; 00:33:07,099<br/>
So he's a partner?
</p><p>481<br/>
00:33:08,001 --&gt; 00:33:10,492<br/>
No. He's listed as special counsel.
</p><p>482<br/>
00:33:10,671 --&gt; 00:33:12,696<br/>
Says he specializes in wills and trusts.
</p><p>483<br/>
00:33:13,607 --&gt; 00:33:16,235<br/>
&lt;i&gt;He goes from criminal prosecution<br/>
to wills and trusts?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>484<br/>
00:33:16,410 --&gt; 00:33:18,776<br/>
&lt;i&gt;He's been there 17 years,<br/>
he's not a partner?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>485<br/>
00:33:18,946 --&gt; 00:33:22,609<br/>
&lt;i&gt;This is the guy they send?<br/>
Who is this guy?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>486<br/>
00:33:36,864 --&gt; 00:33:39,128<br/>
- Hi.<br/>
- Close the door.
</p><p>487<br/>
00:33:39,600 --&gt; 00:33:43,593<br/>
All right. So nobody, none of you,<br/>
had any idea he was coming?
</p><p>488<br/>
00:33:44,171 --&gt; 00:33:46,036<br/>
To Milwaukee? For a deposition?
</p><p>489<br/>
00:33:46,206 --&gt; 00:33:49,767<br/>
We thought there was a settlement.<br/>
There's been some rumors.
</p><p>490<br/>
00:33:49,943 --&gt; 00:33:54,539<br/>
Okay. Look, it's very simple.<br/>
Arthur has a chemical imbalance.
</p><p>491<br/>
00:33:54,715 --&gt; 00:33:58,583<br/>
He's supposed to be taking his medication.
He's fallen behind on that.
</p><p>492<br/>
00:33:58,752 --&gt; 00:34:01,243<br/>
He's on the mend.<br/>
He'll be fine in three or four days.
</p><p>493<br/>
00:34:01,421 --&gt; 00:34:05,585<br/>
Now, I wanna make this crystal clear.<br/>
What happened here stays in this room.
</p><p>494<br/>
00:34:05,759 --&gt; 00:34:08,728<br/>
This is not a piece of information<br/>
you wanna be out in front of.
</p><p>495<br/>
00:34:08,896 --&gt; 00:34:12,195<br/>
Anybody has a problem with that,<br/>
I need to know right now.
</p><p>496<br/>
00:34:13,333 --&gt; 00:34:14,698<br/>
All right.
</p><p>497<br/>
00:34:15,569 --&gt; 00:34:17,400<br/>
We're stuck here overnight.
</p><p>498<br/>
00:34:17,571 --&gt; 00:34:19,869<br/>
I'm gonna take him<br/>
home tomorrow if I can.
</p><p>499<br/>
00:34:20,040 --&gt; 00:34:22,008<br/>
Who's in charge of<br/>
the deposition schedule?
</p><p>500<br/>
00:34:22,175 --&gt; 00:34:23,836<br/>
- I am.<br/>
- Where do we stand with that?
</p><p>501<br/>
00:34:24,011 --&gt; 00:34:26,206<br/>
I guess it's on hold.<br/>
We didn't know what to do.
</p><p>502<br/>
00:34:26,380 --&gt; 00:34:28,439<br/>
Nothing is on hold.<br/>
Keep doing what you were.
</p><p>503<br/>
00:34:28,615 --&gt; 00:34:30,879<br/>
Other side wants to talk,<br/>
they can call New York.
</p><p>504<br/>
00:34:31,051 --&gt; 00:34:34,111<br/>
- I need his briefcase.<br/>
- Arthur's? I don't... I didn't see it.
</p><p>505<br/>
00:34:34,288 --&gt; 00:34:37,382<br/>
- He said it was in the room.<br/>
- It might be the stuff Jody grabbed.
</p><p>506<br/>
00:34:37,758 --&gt; 00:34:39,350<br/>
Find it.
</p><p>507<br/>
00:34:45,332 --&gt; 00:34:49,632<br/>
So all these people, they all start<br/>
having these dreams, okay?
</p><p>508<br/>
00:34:49,803 --&gt; 00:34:54,206<br/>
You know what a vision quest is?<br/>
You know, for, like, Navajos and stuff?
</p><p>509<br/>
00:34:54,374 --&gt; 00:34:57,639<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Yeah. I think so. Like a...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>510<br/>
00:34:58,011 --&gt; 00:34:59,876<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Like a special dream.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>511<br/>
00:35:00,047 --&gt; 00:35:04,609<br/>
Except this is like a whole bunch of people
having the same dream.
</p><p>512<br/>
00:35:04,785 --&gt; 00:35:08,186<br/>
They're all having this dream<br/>
that they should go to this one place.
</p><p>513<br/>
00:35:08,355 --&gt; 00:35:10,380<br/>
They don't know why or anything.
</p><p>514<br/>
00:35:10,557 --&gt; 00:35:13,685<br/>
They just have this feeling<br/>
that they have to go there.
</p><p>515<br/>
00:35:13,860 --&gt; 00:35:15,725<br/>
&lt;i&gt;That they've been summoned.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>516<br/>
00:35:15,896 --&gt; 00:35:17,124<br/>
That's the chapter.
</p><p>517<br/>
00:35:17,297 --&gt; 00:35:20,266<br/>
Seriously, that's what it's called:<br/>
"Summons to Conquest."
</p><p>518<br/>
00:35:20,434 --&gt; 00:35:21,731<br/>
&lt;i&gt;That's the title.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>519<br/>
00:35:21,902 --&gt; 00:35:27,568<br/>
Yeah, but do they know? Do they know<br/>
they're all having the same dream?
</p><p>520<br/>
00:35:27,741 --&gt; 00:35:29,709<br/>
&lt;i&gt;No. That's what's so cool.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>521<br/>
00:35:30,243 --&gt; 00:35:32,177<br/>
They all think it's just them.
</p><p>522<br/>
00:35:32,346 --&gt; 00:35:36,407<br/>
That maybe they're, like, going crazy<br/>
or something, so they don't wanna admit it.
</p><p>523<br/>
00:35:36,583 --&gt; 00:35:38,710<br/>
Yeah, but they're not crazy, are they?
</p><p>524<br/>
00:35:38,885 --&gt; 00:35:42,377<br/>
&lt;i&gt;No. It's real. It's really happening.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>525<br/>
00:35:42,556 --&gt; 00:35:46,185<br/>
Yeah, it is happening, isn't it?
</p><p>526<br/>
00:35:47,394 --&gt; 00:35:52,058<br/>
Something larger than themselves<br/>
and they're not ready, are they...
</p><p>527<br/>
00:35:52,232 --&gt; 00:35:54,029<br/>
...to hear it?
</p><p>528<br/>
00:35:54,201 --&gt; 00:35:56,101<br/>
Yeah. But later they will.
</p><p>529<br/>
00:35:56,269 --&gt; 00:35:59,102<br/>
So if you're gonna read it,<br/>
I don't wanna spoil it.
</p><p>530<br/>
00:36:00,707 --&gt; 00:36:02,538<br/>
What are you doing?<br/>
Who you talking to?
</p><p>531<br/>
00:36:02,709 --&gt; 00:36:04,677<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I called my dad. It's a friend of his.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>532<br/>
00:36:04,845 --&gt; 00:36:08,110<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- Who?<br/>
- Mr. Edens. You don't know him.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>533<br/>
00:36:08,281 --&gt; 00:36:10,943<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- Hello? Hello?<br/>
- Henry, it's after 11.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>534<br/>
00:36:11,118 --&gt; 00:36:12,915<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I gotta get off now.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>535<br/>
00:36:13,086 --&gt; 00:36:17,079<br/>
No. Wait, wait. The book.<br/>
I need the book. The title.
</p><p>536<br/>
00:36:17,691 --&gt; 00:36:19,921<br/>
&lt;i&gt;The book is Realm and Conquest.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>537<br/>
00:36:20,093 --&gt; 00:36:21,856<br/>
Realm and Conquest.
</p><p>538<br/>
00:36:22,029 --&gt; 00:36:25,089<br/>
- It's Book One, with the red cover.<br/>
- Henry, give me the phone.
</p><p>539<br/>
00:36:25,265 --&gt; 00:36:27,825<br/>
I gotta go. Tell my dad I called. Okay?
</p><p>540<br/>
00:36:28,702 --&gt; 00:36:33,105<br/>
Yeah. Yeah. Thank... Thank... Thank...<br/>
Thank you, Henry, thank you.
</p><p>541<br/>
00:36:37,310 --&gt; 00:36:40,746<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Realm and Conquest. Thank you.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>542<br/>
00:37:03,970 --&gt; 00:37:05,995<br/>
Karen? Hi, I'm Michael Clayton.
</p><p>543<br/>
00:37:06,173 --&gt; 00:37:07,640<br/>
- You're late.<br/>
- I know.
</p><p>544<br/>
00:37:07,808 --&gt; 00:37:10,333<br/>
I'm sorry, it was more complicated<br/>
than we thought.
</p><p>545<br/>
00:37:10,510 --&gt; 00:37:12,205<br/>
Where is he?<br/>
We've been here since 5:30.
</p><p>546<br/>
00:37:12,379 --&gt; 00:37:14,540<br/>
- He's asleep.<br/>
- Well, wake him up.
</p><p>547<br/>
00:37:14,715 --&gt; 00:37:16,979<br/>
That's not gonna happen.<br/>
We just got him sedated.
</p><p>548<br/>
00:37:17,484 --&gt; 00:37:20,510<br/>
Once he gets back<br/>
on his regular medication...
</p><p>549<br/>
00:37:20,687 --&gt; 00:37:22,621<br/>
...then it's just a matter of time.
</p><p>550<br/>
00:37:22,789 --&gt; 00:37:25,553<br/>
- Have you seen the video? The tape?<br/>
- I heard about it.
</p><p>551<br/>
00:37:25,826 --&gt; 00:37:28,294<br/>
What happened after is worse.
</p><p>552<br/>
00:37:28,462 --&gt; 00:37:32,364<br/>
This is in the parking lot, okay?<br/>
People running for their cars.
</p><p>553<br/>
00:37:32,532 --&gt; 00:37:34,659<br/>
He's there in his socks, nothing else.
</p><p>554<br/>
00:37:34,835 --&gt; 00:37:38,498<br/>
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.<br/>
I will not sit with this sickness any longer.
</p><p>555<br/>
00:37:38,672 --&gt; 00:37:41,470<br/>
I cannot aid this sickness any longer."
</p><p>556<br/>
00:37:41,641 --&gt; 00:37:43,233<br/>
What does this mean?
</p><p>557<br/>
00:37:43,643 --&gt; 00:37:45,201<br/>
I'm not sure.
</p><p>558<br/>
00:37:45,378 --&gt; 00:37:48,006<br/>
You've been with him the whole evening.
What's he saying?
</p><p>559<br/>
00:37:48,181 --&gt; 00:37:49,978<br/>
He wasn't really making much sense.
</p><p>560<br/>
00:37:50,150 --&gt; 00:37:51,708<br/>
This is totally unacceptable.
</p><p>561<br/>
00:37:51,885 --&gt; 00:37:54,820<br/>
This is a 3-billion-dollar<br/>
class-action lawsuit.
</p><p>562<br/>
00:37:54,988 --&gt; 00:37:56,922<br/>
In the morning, I have to call my board.
</p><p>563<br/>
00:37:57,090 --&gt; 00:38:01,652<br/>
I have to tell them that the architect<br/>
of our entire defense has been arrested...
</p><p>564<br/>
00:38:01,828 --&gt; 00:38:05,992<br/>
...for running naked in a snowstorm,<br/>
chasing the plaintiffs through a parking lot.
</p><p>565<br/>
00:38:06,166 --&gt; 00:38:07,963<br/>
I understand.
</p><p>566<br/>
00:38:09,035 --&gt; 00:38:11,060<br/>
What sickness is he talking about?
</p><p>567<br/>
00:38:11,238 --&gt; 00:38:13,866<br/>
- I don't know. It could be anything.<br/>
- Well, give me one.
</p><p>568<br/>
00:38:14,040 --&gt; 00:38:15,337<br/>
Frostbite.
</p><p>569<br/>
00:38:15,842 --&gt; 00:38:17,469<br/>
You think this is funny?
</p><p>570<br/>
00:38:17,644 --&gt; 00:38:19,908<br/>
Look, his wife was sick<br/>
and she died last year.
</p><p>571<br/>
00:38:20,080 --&gt; 00:38:24,540<br/>
His daughter doesn't talk to him.<br/>
He's all alone. All he does is your case.
</p><p>572<br/>
00:38:24,718 --&gt; 00:38:27,414<br/>
He skipped his pills.<br/>
He had a bad day. That's it.
</p><p>573<br/>
00:38:27,587 --&gt; 00:38:30,283<br/>
And you're somehow<br/>
the authority on this?
</p><p>574<br/>
00:38:30,991 --&gt; 00:38:33,516<br/>
His last episode was eight years ago.<br/>
I was there.
</p><p>575<br/>
00:38:33,693 --&gt; 00:38:36,526<br/>
I helped bring him home.<br/>
I watched him get better. That's it.
</p><p>576<br/>
00:38:36,696 --&gt; 00:38:40,462<br/>
Come on, Karen, you didn't hire this guy
because of his low-key regularity...
</p><p>577<br/>
00:38:40,634 --&gt; 00:38:43,626<br/>
...you hired him because he's a killer,
because he's brilliant...
</p><p>578<br/>
00:38:43,804 --&gt; 00:38:46,466<br/>
...because he's crazy enough<br/>
to grind away on this case...
</p><p>579<br/>
00:38:46,640 --&gt; 00:38:49,404<br/>
...for six years without a break.<br/>
- We pay for his time.
</p><p>580<br/>
00:38:49,576 --&gt; 00:38:51,601<br/>
I thought you wanted an explanation.
</p><p>581<br/>
00:38:51,778 --&gt; 00:38:54,508<br/>
In the morning, I'm calling Marty Bach.
</p><p>582<br/>
00:38:54,681 --&gt; 00:38:57,707<br/>
But, then, you know that.<br/>
Thank you, Michael.
</p><p>583<br/>
00:39:03,590 --&gt; 00:39:05,683<br/>
He was mostly just quiet.
</p><p>584<br/>
00:39:05,859 --&gt; 00:39:08,726<br/>
I heard him moving around,<br/>
I gave him a pill 15 minutes ago.
</p><p>585<br/>
00:39:08,895 --&gt; 00:39:11,386<br/>
- He took it?<br/>
- A deal's a deal, right?
</p><p>586<br/>
00:39:11,565 --&gt; 00:39:13,294<br/>
A super job, Elston.
</p><p>587<br/>
00:39:13,466 --&gt; 00:39:17,129<br/>
You get to New York, you need tickets<br/>
to the game or anything, you let me know.
</p><p>588<br/>
00:39:17,304 --&gt; 00:39:18,737<br/>
I'll do that for sure.
</p><p>589<br/>
00:39:39,125 --&gt; 00:39:40,752<br/>
Did you see her?
</p><p>590<br/>
00:39:41,094 --&gt; 00:39:43,255<br/>
- Who?<br/>
- Anna.
</p><p>591<br/>
00:39:43,797 --&gt; 00:39:45,196<br/>
No.
</p><p>592<br/>
00:39:46,399 --&gt; 00:39:49,926<br/>
No, I didn't see her.<br/>
She probably went back to the farm.
</p><p>593<br/>
00:39:50,804 --&gt; 00:39:52,465<br/>
Well, we need her.
</p><p>594<br/>
00:39:54,307 --&gt; 00:39:59,108<br/>
Marty, even then, and the rest of them,
they won't understand.
</p><p>595<br/>
00:40:00,180 --&gt; 00:40:03,707<br/>
Well, if anybody can explain it to them,
it's you, Arthur.
</p><p>596<br/>
00:40:05,418 --&gt; 00:40:07,613<br/>
No, they're lost.
</p><p>597<br/>
00:40:07,787 --&gt; 00:40:10,847<br/>
- They have what they want.<br/>
- Let it go, man.
</p><p>598<br/>
00:40:11,024 --&gt; 00:40:12,855<br/>
This what you wanted?
</p><p>599<br/>
00:40:14,461 --&gt; 00:40:15,951<br/>
To be a janitor?
</p><p>600<br/>
00:40:16,429 --&gt; 00:40:19,489<br/>
Live like this? All this?
</p><p>601<br/>
00:40:20,300 --&gt; 00:40:21,961<br/>
Do what you do?
</p><p>602<br/>
00:40:22,869 --&gt; 00:40:24,769<br/>
It can't be.
</p><p>603<br/>
00:40:25,639 --&gt; 00:40:26,663<br/>
It's...
</p><p>604<br/>
00:40:26,840 --&gt; 00:40:30,469<br/>
It's a burden,<br/>
that's what I'm trying to tell you.
</p><p>605<br/>
00:40:31,111 --&gt; 00:40:33,238<br/>
That's... That's how it feels.
</p><p>606<br/>
00:40:34,180 --&gt; 00:40:38,879<br/>
Well, I know that<br/>
we've been summoned.
</p><p>607<br/>
00:40:40,654 --&gt; 00:40:42,485<br/>
Get some sleep.
</p><p>608<br/>
00:40:58,371 --&gt; 00:40:59,395<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Hello?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>609<br/>
00:40:59,572 --&gt; 00:41:03,372<br/>
Yes. Hi, I'm looking for Verne?
</p><p>610<br/>
00:41:04,411 --&gt; 00:41:05,742<br/>
&lt;i&gt;You have a number?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>611<br/>
00:41:05,912 --&gt; 00:41:09,006<br/>
Don Jeffries gave me the number.<br/>
He said I could call at any time.
</p><p>612<br/>
00:41:09,182 --&gt; 00:41:11,047<br/>
&lt;i&gt;No. The account number.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>613<br/>
00:41:11,217 --&gt; 00:41:15,415<br/>
The code? I do.<br/>
I have it right here. One moment.
</p><p>614<br/>
00:41:17,357 --&gt; 00:41:19,348<br/>
Excuse me one moment.
</p><p>615<br/>
00:41:19,826 --&gt; 00:41:23,421<br/>
It's right here. 12-BKR-6.
</p><p>616<br/>
00:41:23,596 --&gt; 00:41:25,655<br/>
<strong>12-BKR-6.</strong>
</p><p>617<br/>
00:41:27,100 --&gt; 00:41:29,091<br/>
Am I speaking with Verne?
</p><p>618<br/>
00:41:30,203 --&gt; 00:41:31,500<br/>
&lt;i&gt;It's Mr. Verne.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>619<br/>
00:41:31,671 --&gt; 00:41:35,004<br/>
Mr. Verne. I'm sorry, it's so late.
</p><p>620<br/>
00:41:35,175 --&gt; 00:41:37,166<br/>
Don said that I could...
</p><p>621<br/>
00:41:38,878 --&gt; 00:41:41,108<br/>
I'm not exactly sure how this works.
</p><p>622<br/>
00:41:41,281 --&gt; 00:41:43,272<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Do you have e-mail<br/>
at your current location?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>623<br/>
00:41:43,450 --&gt; 00:41:44,678<br/>
I do.
</p><p>624<br/>
00:41:44,851 --&gt; 00:41:47,012<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- Are you alone?<br/>
- I am.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>625<br/>
00:41:47,787 --&gt; 00:41:52,019<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Okay, I'm gonna upload you<br/>
a little encryption package we like to use.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>626<br/>
00:41:52,192 --&gt; 00:41:53,591<br/>
&lt;i&gt;It's pretty self-explanatory.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>627<br/>
00:41:53,760 --&gt; 00:41:55,057<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- Okay.<br/>
- Okay.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>628<br/>
00:41:55,228 --&gt; 00:41:58,197<br/>
&lt;i&gt;But you have to give me a minute<br/>
to get to my desk. Hold on.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>629<br/>
00:41:58,365 --&gt; 00:42:00,060<br/>
Okay. Thank you.
</p><p>630<br/>
00:42:24,324 --&gt; 00:42:26,986<br/>
&lt;i&gt;What I was wondering is...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>631<br/>
00:42:27,160 --&gt; 00:42:29,993<br/>
...I have an option on the lease<br/>
for six more years.
</p><p>632<br/>
00:42:30,163 --&gt; 00:42:32,825<br/>
I was wondering if there's any way<br/>
I could lay that off.
</p><p>633<br/>
00:42:32,999 --&gt; 00:42:35,991<br/>
Is the lease worth anything?
</p><p>634<br/>
00:42:39,472 --&gt; 00:42:41,963<br/>
Eighty-nine hundred a month. It's...
</p><p>635<br/>
00:42:42,409 --&gt; 00:42:45,139<br/>
The fixtures are gone, but there's...
</p><p>636<br/>
00:42:46,846 --&gt; 00:42:50,043<br/>
But there's the bar, there's a kitchen,
it's a great space.
</p><p>637<br/>
00:42:51,618 --&gt; 00:42:53,176<br/>
But there's a...
</p><p>638<br/>
00:42:57,490 --&gt; 00:43:00,584<br/>
Yeah, I understand. No, I understand.
</p><p>639<br/>
00:43:02,362 --&gt; 00:43:04,455<br/>
Okay, yeah, I will.
</p><p>640<br/>
00:43:05,098 --&gt; 00:43:06,622<br/>
All right. Thanks.
</p><p>641<br/>
00:43:16,976 --&gt; 00:43:18,568<br/>
Come on, Arthur.
</p><p>642<br/>
00:43:21,181 --&gt; 00:43:22,478<br/>
Arthur!
</p><p>643<br/>
00:43:23,950 --&gt; 00:43:25,042<br/>
Arthur, open the door.
</p><p>644<br/>
00:43:28,621 --&gt; 00:43:30,486<br/>
Arthur, open the door!
</p><p>645<br/>
00:43:33,326 --&gt; 00:43:35,726<br/>
Arthur, open the goddamn door!
</p><p>646<br/>
00:43:37,030 --&gt; 00:43:38,292<br/>
Arthur, op...!
</p><p>647<br/>
00:43:39,099 --&gt; 00:43:41,192<br/>
Open the fucking door!
</p><p>648<br/>
00:43:47,574 --&gt; 00:43:49,041<br/>
Arthur!
</p><p>649<br/>
00:43:49,843 --&gt; 00:43:52,471<br/>
Goddamn it, Arthur! Open the fucking...!
</p><p>650<br/>
00:44:02,922 --&gt; 00:44:04,116<br/>
Arthur?!
</p><p>651<br/>
00:44:15,435 --&gt; 00:44:17,266<br/>
- Mr. Verne, hey.<br/>
- Hey, Danny.
</p><p>652<br/>
00:44:17,437 --&gt; 00:44:19,701<br/>
You guys are early.<br/>
I was pulling the other bags.
</p><p>653<br/>
00:44:19,873 --&gt; 00:44:22,740<br/>
You can put them back.<br/>
There's been a change of plans, sorry.
</p><p>654<br/>
00:44:22,909 --&gt; 00:44:24,809<br/>
- We ready?<br/>
- Yep.
</p><p>655<br/>
00:44:28,948 --&gt; 00:44:31,007<br/>
For chrissake.
</p><p>656<br/>
00:44:31,184 --&gt; 00:44:33,049<br/>
Don Jeffries signed this?
</p><p>657<br/>
00:44:33,520 --&gt; 00:44:36,080<br/>
That's really his signature?
</p><p>658<br/>
00:44:36,256 --&gt; 00:44:38,224<br/>
Where's the original?
</p><p>659<br/>
00:44:38,391 --&gt; 00:44:43,454<br/>
We had a warehouse fire five years ago.
We lost a number of documents.
</p><p>660<br/>
00:44:49,569 --&gt; 00:44:52,436<br/>
What the hell is this doing<br/>
in Arthur's bag?
</p><p>661<br/>
00:44:53,072 --&gt; 00:44:54,596<br/>
Well, I don't know, Marty.
</p><p>662<br/>
00:44:54,774 --&gt; 00:44:58,733<br/>
That's something I was hoping<br/>
you might be able to tell me.
</p><p>663<br/>
00:45:03,483 --&gt; 00:45:05,075<br/>
What are we looking for?
</p><p>664<br/>
00:45:05,251 --&gt; 00:45:09,449<br/>
If it says U/North, pull it aside.<br/>
Anything that says U/North.
</p><p>665<br/>
00:45:10,924 --&gt; 00:45:12,414<br/>
What a mess this is.
</p><p>666<br/>
00:45:17,063 --&gt; 00:45:18,291<br/>
I want all this...
</p><p>667<br/>
00:45:19,232 --&gt; 00:45:23,328<br/>
...everything here, I want it all packed up
and sent up to the house.
</p><p>668<br/>
00:45:24,437 --&gt; 00:45:25,836<br/>
Any luck, Michael?
</p><p>669<br/>
00:45:26,573 --&gt; 00:45:30,669<br/>
He booked a limo from Newark Airport at 3,
got out at West Fourth Street...
</p><p>670<br/>
00:45:30,843 --&gt; 00:45:32,811<br/>
...tipped the driver 100 bucks<br/>
and walked away.
</p><p>671<br/>
00:45:32,979 --&gt; 00:45:34,173<br/>
Did you try his apartment?
</p><p>672<br/>
00:45:34,347 --&gt; 00:45:35,507<br/>
- He moved.<br/>
- I know.
</p><p>673<br/>
00:45:35,682 --&gt; 00:45:38,048<br/>
It's a loft. No doorman.<br/>
I rang, nobody answered.
</p><p>674<br/>
00:45:38,218 --&gt; 00:45:40,880<br/>
- I called, I got the machine.<br/>
- So he could be anywhere.
</p><p>675<br/>
00:45:41,054 --&gt; 00:45:44,046<br/>
Arthur downtown is not a good idea.<br/>
Some goddamn loft.
</p><p>676<br/>
00:45:44,224 --&gt; 00:45:46,954<br/>
- Where's his daughter?<br/>
- I don't know. Spain, India.
</p><p>677<br/>
00:45:47,126 --&gt; 00:45:50,254<br/>
Mars. She's crazier than he'll ever be.
</p><p>678<br/>
00:45:50,430 --&gt; 00:45:52,261<br/>
Barry's taking over on U/North.
</p><p>679<br/>
00:45:52,432 --&gt; 00:45:54,229<br/>
We got a lot of groveling to do.
</p><p>680<br/>
00:45:54,400 --&gt; 00:45:56,493<br/>
You didn't exactly charm Karen Crowder.
</p><p>681<br/>
00:45:56,669 --&gt; 00:45:57,897<br/>
I was punting.
</p><p>682<br/>
00:45:58,071 --&gt; 00:46:00,733<br/>
You gotta saddle up here<br/>
and get things under control.
</p><p>683<br/>
00:46:00,907 --&gt; 00:46:01,896<br/>
Saddle up?
</p><p>684<br/>
00:46:02,075 --&gt; 00:46:05,135<br/>
He needs to be under a doctor's care.<br/>
He needs to be admitted.
</p><p>685<br/>
00:46:05,311 --&gt; 00:46:07,643<br/>
- Where?<br/>
- Does that really matter?
</p><p>686<br/>
00:46:07,814 --&gt; 00:46:10,715<br/>
Michael, U/North needs to know<br/>
he's under control.
</p><p>687<br/>
00:46:10,883 --&gt; 00:46:14,250<br/>
He's in a facility. They've been shook up.
They need to be reassured.
</p><p>688<br/>
00:46:14,420 --&gt; 00:46:16,615<br/>
- It's not gonna be that easy.<br/>
- Why the hell not?
</p><p>689<br/>
00:46:16,789 --&gt; 00:46:20,589<br/>
Because the laws in New York are<br/>
pretty tough on involuntary commitment.
</p><p>690<br/>
00:46:20,760 --&gt; 00:46:22,318<br/>
Did you see this fucking tape?
</p><p>691<br/>
00:46:22,495 --&gt; 00:46:25,191<br/>
I'm not arguing with you, Barry.<br/>
I'm telling you how it is.
</p><p>692<br/>
00:46:25,365 --&gt; 00:46:28,493<br/>
You know what, guys?<br/>
We got 600 lawyers in this place.
</p><p>693<br/>
00:46:28,668 --&gt; 00:46:32,160<br/>
Why don't we find out which one knows<br/>
about psychiatric-commitment statutes?
</p><p>694<br/>
00:46:32,338 --&gt; 00:46:35,000<br/>
I can tell you that right now. It's Arthur.
</p><p>695<br/>
00:46:46,653 --&gt; 00:46:48,678<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I'm at the door. We're good to go.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>696<br/>
00:46:49,856 --&gt; 00:46:53,519<br/>
Yeah, roger that.<br/>
Let's keep a radio check every five, okay?
</p><p>697<br/>
00:46:53,693 --&gt; 00:46:55,854<br/>
Every five minutes, copy that.
</p><p>698<br/>
00:47:31,964 --&gt; 00:47:34,057<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Hello, you've reached Arthur's machine.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>699<br/>
00:47:34,233 --&gt; 00:47:37,498<br/>
&lt;i&gt;If you wish to leave a message,<br/>
please do so after the tone.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>700<br/>
00:47:38,638 --&gt; 00:47:40,902<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Arthur, pick up the phone.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>701<br/>
00:47:41,074 --&gt; 00:47:45,477<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Arthur, pick up the phone<br/>
and talk to me.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>702<br/>
00:47:47,313 --&gt; 00:47:50,282<br/>
&lt;i&gt;No? Not gonna do it?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>703<br/>
00:47:51,084 --&gt; 00:47:54,178<br/>
What happened yesterday morning,<br/>
forget it. It doesn't matter.
</p><p>704<br/>
00:47:54,354 --&gt; 00:47:56,413<br/>
Someday you and I<br/>
are gonna laugh about it.
</p><p>705<br/>
00:47:56,589 --&gt; 00:47:58,056<br/>
But you gotta call me back.
</p><p>706<br/>
00:47:58,224 --&gt; 00:48:00,624<br/>
You gotta call me back soon, Arthur.
</p><p>707<br/>
00:48:00,960 --&gt; 00:48:02,894<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I'll tell you what.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>708<br/>
00:48:03,062 --&gt; 00:48:06,054<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Because you said it yourself.<br/>
Part of this is definitely madness.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>709<br/>
00:48:06,232 --&gt; 00:48:08,598<br/>
&lt;i&gt;And there's a chemical part.<br/>
We both know it.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>710<br/>
00:48:08,968 --&gt; 00:48:10,993<br/>
&lt;i&gt;But if you're willing to start with that...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>711<br/>
00:48:11,170 --&gt; 00:48:14,298<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... then I'm more than willing to<br/>
meet you halfway and say, yes...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>712<br/>
00:48:14,474 --&gt; 00:48:17,932<br/>
...this situation sucks.<br/>
This case sucks. U/North sucks.
</p><p>713<br/>
00:48:18,111 --&gt; 00:48:20,705<br/>
We can start with that.<br/>
All right, Arthur? You hear me?
</p><p>714<br/>
00:48:20,880 --&gt; 00:48:22,541<br/>
You're right about what we are.
</p><p>715<br/>
00:48:23,249 --&gt; 00:48:26,685<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I'm saying you're crazy. I'm saying<br/>
that your behavior is out of control.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>716<br/>
00:48:26,853 --&gt; 00:48:28,445<br/>
&lt;i&gt;But I'm telling you you're right.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>717<br/>
00:48:28,621 --&gt; 00:48:32,079<br/>
You called it. We're janitors, I get it.
</p><p>718<br/>
00:48:34,026 --&gt; 00:48:35,960<br/>
But we came to this, Arthur.
</p><p>719<br/>
00:48:36,896 --&gt; 00:48:39,956<br/>
&lt;i&gt;We made decisions.<br/>
It didn't happen overnight.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>720<br/>
00:48:40,133 --&gt; 00:48:44,229<br/>
You can't just suddenly stop and say,<br/>
"That's it, game over. I'm into miracles."
</p><p>721<br/>
00:48:45,171 --&gt; 00:48:46,968<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Arthur. Come on.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>722<br/>
00:48:48,608 --&gt; 00:48:50,735<br/>
Goddamn it,<br/>
pick up the phone and talk to me.
</p><p>723<br/>
00:48:50,910 --&gt; 00:48:53,242<br/>
Because whatever else<br/>
you think is so important...
</p><p>724<br/>
00:48:53,413 --&gt; 00:48:56,143<br/>
...you better let me help you,<br/>
because I'm telling you...
</p><p>725<br/>
00:48:56,315 --&gt; 00:49:00,513<br/>
...janitor to janitor, I don't see<br/>
anybody else with a broom on the horizon.
</p><p>726<br/>
00:49:00,686 --&gt; 00:49:03,120<br/>
It's me, buddy. I'm the...
</p><p>727<br/>
00:49:03,289 --&gt; 00:49:07,282<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Mailbox is full.<br/>
Your message cannot be recorded.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>728<br/>
00:50:07,787 --&gt; 00:50:10,255<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- Hello?<br/>
- Hello. Is Anna there?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>729<br/>
00:50:10,423 --&gt; 00:50:11,788<br/>
Hang on.
</p><p>730<br/>
00:50:15,194 --&gt; 00:50:16,718<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Anna!&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>731<br/>
00:50:18,731 --&gt; 00:50:20,824<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Where is she? Anna!&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>732<br/>
00:50:23,436 --&gt; 00:50:25,131<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- Anna!<br/>
- Anna!&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>733<br/>
00:50:26,105 --&gt; 00:50:28,403<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Anna, you've got a phone call!&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>734<br/>
00:50:31,043 --&gt; 00:50:33,136<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Where is she? Anna!&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>735<br/>
00:50:44,524 --&gt; 00:50:45,616<br/>
Hello?
</p><p>736<br/>
00:50:46,092 --&gt; 00:50:48,219<br/>
Anna, hi. It's Arthur.
</p><p>737<br/>
00:50:48,394 --&gt; 00:50:50,954<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- Hey.<br/>
- Did you get some sleep?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>738<br/>
00:50:51,397 --&gt; 00:50:52,955<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I guess.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>739<br/>
00:50:53,132 --&gt; 00:50:55,100<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Did you think about what we said?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>740<br/>
00:50:55,268 --&gt; 00:50:57,896<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- Yeah.<br/>
- You didn't tell anybody, did you?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>741<br/>
00:50:58,070 --&gt; 00:51:02,598<br/>
No. My sister's spying on me,<br/>
but that's normal.
</p><p>742<br/>
00:51:02,775 --&gt; 00:51:05,471<br/>
Yeah. Because I meant what I said.
</p><p>743<br/>
00:51:05,645 --&gt; 00:51:08,045<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I know. I know. It's just...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>744<br/>
00:51:09,181 --&gt; 00:51:12,981<br/>
...there's, like, 450 people in this lawsuit.
</p><p>745<br/>
00:51:13,819 --&gt; 00:51:15,946<br/>
Why are you choosing me?
</p><p>746<br/>
00:51:17,256 --&gt; 00:51:19,622<br/>
I don't know. I'm crazy, right?
</p><p>747<br/>
00:51:19,792 --&gt; 00:51:21,350<br/>
&lt;i&gt;That's for sure.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>748<br/>
00:51:21,527 --&gt; 00:51:23,495<br/>
I mean, does it...?<br/>
Does it really matter?
</p><p>749<br/>
00:51:23,663 --&gt; 00:51:27,827<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I mean, isn't it what we wait for?<br/>
To meet someone? And they're...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>750<br/>
00:51:28,000 --&gt; 00:51:29,297<br/>
&lt;i&gt;They're like a lens...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>751<br/>
00:51:29,468 --&gt; 00:51:33,131<br/>
...and suddenly you're looking<br/>
through them and everything changes...
</p><p>752<br/>
00:51:33,306 --&gt; 00:51:35,297<br/>
...and nothing can ever be<br/>
the same again.
</p><p>753<br/>
00:51:35,474 --&gt; 00:51:37,135<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Who you talking to?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>754<br/>
00:51:37,310 --&gt; 00:51:40,040<br/>
It's for me, okay? I get calls too.
</p><p>755<br/>
00:51:40,212 --&gt; 00:51:41,645<br/>
That guy?
</p><p>756<br/>
00:51:41,814 --&gt; 00:51:45,306<br/>
Same guy. Same guy.
</p><p>757<br/>
00:51:45,952 --&gt; 00:51:47,317<br/>
Sorry.
</p><p>758<br/>
00:51:48,354 --&gt; 00:51:52,654<br/>
No. That's... That's okay.<br/>
My mother used to listen to my calls.
</p><p>759<br/>
00:51:52,825 --&gt; 00:51:55,521<br/>
&lt;i&gt;She can't believe I can do anything<br/>
on my own.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>760<br/>
00:51:55,695 --&gt; 00:51:57,162<br/>
Well, that'll change.
</p><p>761<br/>
00:51:57,897 --&gt; 00:51:59,194<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I guess.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>762<br/>
00:51:59,365 --&gt; 00:52:02,391<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Yeah, but, see,<br/>
that's something we can show her.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>763<br/>
00:52:02,568 --&gt; 00:52:05,696<br/>
&lt;i&gt;That you can do something.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>764<br/>
00:52:05,871 --&gt; 00:52:08,999<br/>
&lt;i&gt;That we could... We could do that together
if you want. I mean...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>765<br/>
00:52:09,175 --&gt; 00:52:11,439<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I mean that I can help you do that.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>766<br/>
00:52:12,378 --&gt; 00:52:15,006<br/>
I can get you 12 by Monday.
</p><p>767<br/>
00:52:15,181 --&gt; 00:52:17,240<br/>
Twelve's weak. Twelve looks bad.
</p><p>768<br/>
00:52:17,416 --&gt; 00:52:18,883<br/>
How do you figure that?
</p><p>769<br/>
00:52:19,051 --&gt; 00:52:22,612<br/>
They look at 75 and they look at you<br/>
and they wonder what the problem is.
</p><p>770<br/>
00:52:22,788 --&gt; 00:52:24,881<br/>
You say 12.<br/>
That's gonna make people nervous.
</p><p>771<br/>
00:52:25,057 --&gt; 00:52:27,992<br/>
This was the day before yesterday.<br/>
Let me get my ducks in order.
</p><p>772<br/>
00:52:28,160 --&gt; 00:52:29,388<br/>
What's the car worth?
</p><p>773<br/>
00:52:29,562 --&gt; 00:52:31,757<br/>
It's a lease. It's the firm's.
</p><p>774<br/>
00:52:31,931 --&gt; 00:52:35,833<br/>
So? You go to the bank.<br/>
You've got the apartment. You refinance.
</p><p>775<br/>
00:52:36,002 --&gt; 00:52:38,630<br/>
I can't. I did that three months ago.
</p><p>776<br/>
00:52:39,572 --&gt; 00:52:41,267<br/>
Are you back at the tables?
</p><p>777<br/>
00:52:41,440 --&gt; 00:52:44,375<br/>
Like I need that kind of action.<br/>
I don't have enough going on.
</p><p>778<br/>
00:52:47,546 --&gt; 00:52:49,571<br/>
I hope you're kidding.
</p><p>779<br/>
00:52:49,749 --&gt; 00:52:53,810<br/>
If he finds out you're playing cards with
his money, there's no dialogue after that.
</p><p>780<br/>
00:52:55,421 --&gt; 00:52:57,412<br/>
Do everyone a favor.
</p><p>781<br/>
00:52:57,623 --&gt; 00:53:02,026<br/>
Get out the treasure map<br/>
and start digging.
</p><p>782<br/>
00:53:02,795 --&gt; 00:53:04,285<br/>
You got a week.
</p><p>783<br/>
00:53:05,631 --&gt; 00:53:08,429<br/>
- Hey, Michael. How are you?<br/>
- Hi, Cindy. I'm good.
</p><p>784<br/>
00:53:08,601 --&gt; 00:53:11,900<br/>
Come in. He's been on the phone<br/>
all morning. What else is new?
</p><p>785<br/>
00:53:12,071 --&gt; 00:53:14,096<br/>
I am trying to get him out<br/>
in 15 minutes.
</p><p>786<br/>
00:53:14,273 --&gt; 00:53:16,707<br/>
- Is he upstairs?<br/>
- He's taken over the living room.
</p><p>787<br/>
00:53:16,876 --&gt; 00:53:18,776<br/>
What are you guys doing?<br/>
Get down here.
</p><p>788<br/>
00:53:18,944 --&gt; 00:53:23,711<br/>
Soroyo, I told you to keep an eye on<br/>
these kids, make sure they're downstairs.
</p><p>789<br/>
00:53:38,230 --&gt; 00:53:39,720<br/>
Marty?
</p><p>790<br/>
00:53:41,967 --&gt; 00:53:44,834<br/>
You know what he's doing?<br/>
He's making their case.
</p><p>791<br/>
00:53:45,504 --&gt; 00:53:48,371<br/>
I'm going through his files here,<br/>
I'm reading this...
</p><p>792<br/>
00:53:48,541 --&gt; 00:53:50,406<br/>
...he's building a case against U/North.
</p><p>793<br/>
00:53:50,576 --&gt; 00:53:52,567<br/>
- Nobody's gonna let him do that.<br/>
- Let him?
</p><p>794<br/>
00:53:52,745 --&gt; 00:53:54,144<br/>
Who the hell's gonna stop him?
</p><p>795<br/>
00:53:54,680 --&gt; 00:53:57,342<br/>
You know what I just heard?<br/>
He's calling these plaintiffs.
</p><p>796<br/>
00:53:57,516 --&gt; 00:54:01,714<br/>
This woman from the deposition,<br/>
he's calling these people now.
</p><p>797<br/>
00:54:01,887 --&gt; 00:54:04,822<br/>
He's got these discovery documents.<br/>
This is a fucking nightmare.
</p><p>798<br/>
00:54:04,990 --&gt; 00:54:08,551<br/>
I tried him. Can't even leave a message.
He's got the machine jammed up.
</p><p>799<br/>
00:54:08,728 --&gt; 00:54:11,253<br/>
- Is that his briefcase?<br/>
- Yeah.
</p><p>800<br/>
00:54:11,831 --&gt; 00:54:13,628<br/>
- Why?<br/>
- We've been looking for it.
</p><p>801<br/>
00:54:13,799 --&gt; 00:54:17,326<br/>
I don't know. It came up here<br/>
with all the other stuff from his office.
</p><p>802<br/>
00:54:17,503 --&gt; 00:54:21,234<br/>
You can't believe<br/>
the crap he's got in here.
</p><p>803<br/>
00:54:22,274 --&gt; 00:54:23,298<br/>
Listen, Marty...
</p><p>804<br/>
00:54:25,277 --&gt; 00:54:27,609<br/>
...I'm in a bind here.
</p><p>805<br/>
00:54:28,781 --&gt; 00:54:31,511<br/>
I need a loan. I need 80 grand.
</p><p>806<br/>
00:54:32,685 --&gt; 00:54:35,017<br/>
- I thought you were done with that.<br/>
- It's not that.
</p><p>807<br/>
00:54:35,187 --&gt; 00:54:38,020<br/>
It's not the cards. It's none of that.<br/>
It's the restaurant.
</p><p>808<br/>
00:54:38,190 --&gt; 00:54:39,782<br/>
Eighty thousand.
</p><p>809<br/>
00:54:39,959 --&gt; 00:54:41,426<br/>
I'm sorry to jump you like this.
</p><p>810<br/>
00:54:41,594 --&gt; 00:54:44,358<br/>
I've been trying to get a meeting<br/>
with you for two weeks.
</p><p>811<br/>
00:54:45,131 --&gt; 00:54:48,430<br/>
And I know about the merger,<br/>
whether I'm supposed to or not.
</p><p>812<br/>
00:54:48,834 --&gt; 00:54:50,529<br/>
There's nothing final on the merger.
</p><p>813<br/>
00:54:50,703 --&gt; 00:54:53,638<br/>
Well, that's why I'm asking you now.<br/>
You're my meal ticket.
</p><p>814<br/>
00:54:53,806 --&gt; 00:54:56,468<br/>
Once you're out,<br/>
it's me and Barry with strangers...
</p><p>815<br/>
00:54:56,642 --&gt; 00:54:58,542<br/>
...and I'm trying to explain what I do.
</p><p>816<br/>
00:54:58,711 --&gt; 00:55:01,771<br/>
Everybody knows how valuable you are.<br/>
Everybody who needs to know.
</p><p>817<br/>
00:55:01,947 --&gt; 00:55:03,608<br/>
I'm 45 years old and I'm broke.
</p><p>818<br/>
00:55:03,783 --&gt; 00:55:06,479<br/>
I've been riding shotgun for 12 years<br/>
and I got no equity.
</p><p>819<br/>
00:55:06,652 --&gt; 00:55:08,244<br/>
I'm sorry, I don't feel reassured.
</p><p>820<br/>
00:55:08,420 --&gt; 00:55:10,445<br/>
Nobody told you to<br/>
go into the bar business.
</p><p>821<br/>
00:55:10,623 --&gt; 00:55:13,183<br/>
I only opened it so I'd have<br/>
something else, a way out.
</p><p>822<br/>
00:55:13,359 --&gt; 00:55:15,020<br/>
I had no idea you were so unhappy.
</p><p>823<br/>
00:55:15,194 --&gt; 00:55:18,220<br/>
How many times did I ask you<br/>
to put me back on a litigation team?
</p><p>824<br/>
00:55:18,397 --&gt; 00:55:20,058<br/>
- How many?<br/>
- Anybody can go to court.
</p><p>825<br/>
00:55:20,232 --&gt; 00:55:21,460<br/>
You think that's special?
</p><p>826<br/>
00:55:21,634 --&gt; 00:55:24,296<br/>
- I was good at it.<br/>
- Wonderful. So are a lot of people.
</p><p>827<br/>
00:55:24,770 --&gt; 00:55:28,137<br/>
At this, what you do, you're great.
</p><p>828<br/>
00:55:28,307 --&gt; 00:55:32,573<br/>
For chrissakes, you got something<br/>
everybody wants. You have a niche.
</p><p>829<br/>
00:55:32,745 --&gt; 00:55:35,737<br/>
You made a place.<br/>
You made a niche for yourself.
</p><p>830<br/>
00:55:35,915 --&gt; 00:55:39,976<br/>
And if it's nostalgia..."You should've seen
me when I was a DA back in Queens."
</p><p>831<br/>
00:55:40,152 --&gt; 00:55:43,553<br/>
- Let me give you a serious piece of advice:
Leave it there.
</p><p>832<br/>
00:55:43,722 --&gt; 00:55:47,715<br/>
God forbid you're not as good as<br/>
you remember. I've seen that happen too.
</p><p>833<br/>
00:55:48,594 --&gt; 00:55:51,119<br/>
But I didn't come here for advice, did I?
</p><p>834<br/>
00:55:51,697 --&gt; 00:55:54,996<br/>
So this is what? I give you the loan<br/>
or you don't help out with Arthur?
</p><p>835<br/>
00:55:55,167 --&gt; 00:55:56,759<br/>
- I never said that.<br/>
- No?
</p><p>836<br/>
00:55:56,936 --&gt; 00:55:58,267<br/>
Maybe you should have.
</p><p>837<br/>
00:55:58,437 --&gt; 00:56:03,101<br/>
I don't know how you're gonna take care
of this, but this, this is cancer.
</p><p>838<br/>
00:56:03,275 --&gt; 00:56:06,438<br/>
This is something, we don't get it<br/>
reined in and cleaned up soon...
</p><p>839<br/>
00:56:06,612 --&gt; 00:56:08,739<br/>
...everything's vulnerable. Everything.
</p><p>840<br/>
00:56:09,548 --&gt; 00:56:12,881<br/>
- What are you telling me?<br/>
- That I'm counting on you.
</p><p>841<br/>
00:56:13,252 --&gt; 00:56:17,211<br/>
I'm telling you that by this time next week,
Arthur will be under control...
</p><p>842<br/>
00:56:17,389 --&gt; 00:56:20,950<br/>
...and everybody who needs to will have
been reminded of your infinite value.
</p><p>843<br/>
00:56:21,126 --&gt; 00:56:22,423<br/>
Jesus, Marty.
</p><p>844<br/>
00:56:22,695 --&gt; 00:56:24,094<br/>
Hey.
</p><p>845<br/>
00:56:24,263 --&gt; 00:56:26,288<br/>
When did you get so fucking delicate?
</p><p>846<br/>
00:56:27,399 --&gt; 00:56:28,957<br/>
I'm late.
</p><p>847<br/>
00:57:08,607 --&gt; 00:57:11,667<br/>
Why don't you just call Uncle Gene<br/>
and get the cops to help you?
</p><p>848<br/>
00:57:11,844 --&gt; 00:57:13,869<br/>
It's not that kind of a problem.
</p><p>849<br/>
00:57:15,514 --&gt; 00:57:17,914<br/>
- How much longer are we doing this?<br/>
- I don't know.
</p><p>850<br/>
00:57:29,929 --&gt; 00:57:33,729<br/>
If he comes back to get his car,<br/>
you call that number and let me know.
</p><p>851<br/>
00:57:33,899 --&gt; 00:57:37,027<br/>
- Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
- Okay. You're welcome.
</p><p>852<br/>
00:57:44,410 --&gt; 00:57:47,402<br/>
If we're not gonna get to the movie,<br/>
why don't you just say so?
</p><p>853<br/>
00:57:47,579 --&gt; 00:57:50,343<br/>
- What?<br/>
- I wanna go home.
</p><p>854<br/>
00:57:50,516 --&gt; 00:57:52,313<br/>
Come on, Henry.
</p><p>855<br/>
00:57:55,721 --&gt; 00:57:56,710<br/>
Hold up!
</p><p>856<br/>
00:57:59,758 --&gt; 00:58:01,623<br/>
Stay in the car. Lock the door.
</p><p>857<br/>
00:58:03,262 --&gt; 00:58:06,231<br/>
Arthur! Arthur!
</p><p>858<br/>
00:58:06,398 --&gt; 00:58:07,729<br/>
Wait up.
</p><p>859<br/>
00:58:08,567 --&gt; 00:58:11,968<br/>
Michael. Jeez. You scared me.
</p><p>860<br/>
00:58:13,372 --&gt; 00:58:16,102<br/>
- Making a delivery?<br/>
- No, no, no.
</p><p>861<br/>
00:58:16,942 --&gt; 00:58:19,570<br/>
Very funny. No, nothing like that.
</p><p>862<br/>
00:58:19,745 --&gt; 00:58:23,340<br/>
Here, take one, please. Really.<br/>
It's... It's still warm.
</p><p>863<br/>
00:58:23,515 --&gt; 00:58:25,142<br/>
It's the best bread I ever tasted.
</p><p>864<br/>
00:58:29,188 --&gt; 00:58:30,917<br/>
So welcome home.
</p><p>865<br/>
00:58:32,091 --&gt; 00:58:35,026<br/>
I know, the hotel. I'm sorry.
</p><p>866<br/>
00:58:35,194 --&gt; 00:58:37,560<br/>
I was beginning to feel<br/>
a little overwhelmed.
</p><p>867<br/>
00:58:37,730 --&gt; 00:58:39,561<br/>
- But you're feeling better now?<br/>
- Yeah.
</p><p>868<br/>
00:58:39,732 --&gt; 00:58:42,223<br/>
- Much better, definitely.<br/>
- Not enough to call me back.
</p><p>869<br/>
00:58:42,401 --&gt; 00:58:45,632<br/>
Well, I was trying<br/>
to gather my thoughts...
</p><p>870<br/>
00:58:45,804 --&gt; 00:58:49,399<br/>
...before I called you,<br/>
and that's what I was doing.
</p><p>871<br/>
00:58:50,042 --&gt; 00:58:51,441<br/>
And how's that going?
</p><p>872<br/>
00:58:51,610 --&gt; 00:58:54,078<br/>
Yes, it's good, very good. I just...
</p><p>873<br/>
00:58:54,380 --&gt; 00:58:59,784<br/>
Well, I just need to make my thoughts<br/>
a little bit more precise. That's...
</p><p>874<br/>
00:58:59,952 --&gt; 00:59:01,249<br/>
That's my goal.
</p><p>875<br/>
00:59:01,420 --&gt; 00:59:04,787<br/>
As good as this feels,<br/>
you know where it goes.
</p><p>876<br/>
00:59:04,957 --&gt; 00:59:06,356<br/>
No. No. You're wrong.
</p><p>877<br/>
00:59:06,525 --&gt; 00:59:09,619<br/>
What makes this feel good<br/>
is that I don't know where it goes.
</p><p>878<br/>
00:59:10,796 --&gt; 00:59:13,959<br/>
How do I talk to you, Arthur?<br/>
So you hear me?
</p><p>879<br/>
00:59:14,133 --&gt; 00:59:18,661<br/>
Like a child? Like a nut?<br/>
Like everything's fine?
</p><p>880<br/>
00:59:18,837 --&gt; 00:59:22,603<br/>
What's the secret?<br/>
Because I need you to hear me.
</p><p>881<br/>
00:59:22,775 --&gt; 00:59:25,539<br/>
- Well, I hear everything.<br/>
- Then hear this.
</p><p>882<br/>
00:59:25,978 --&gt; 00:59:29,937<br/>
You need help.<br/>
Before this goes too far, you need help.
</p><p>883<br/>
00:59:30,115 --&gt; 00:59:31,343<br/>
You got great cards here.
</p><p>884<br/>
00:59:31,517 --&gt; 00:59:34,850<br/>
If you keep your clothes on, you can<br/>
do any goddamn thing you want.
</p><p>885<br/>
00:59:35,020 --&gt; 00:59:38,251<br/>
You want out, you're out.<br/>
You wanna bake bread, go with God.
</p><p>886<br/>
00:59:38,424 --&gt; 00:59:41,120<br/>
There's only one wrong answer<br/>
in this whole goddamn pile...
</p><p>887<br/>
00:59:41,293 --&gt; 00:59:43,056<br/>
...and you've got<br/>
your arms around it.
</p><p>888<br/>
00:59:43,228 --&gt; 00:59:46,527<br/>
- Well, I said I was sorry.<br/>
- You thought the hotel was overwhelming?
</p><p>889<br/>
00:59:46,698 --&gt; 00:59:49,258<br/>
You piss on this case,<br/>
they'll cut you off at the knees.
</p><p>890<br/>
00:59:49,435 --&gt; 00:59:52,700<br/>
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm covering for you.
</p><p>891<br/>
00:59:52,871 --&gt; 00:59:56,363<br/>
I'm telling them everything's fine.<br/>
You're fine. Everybody's cool.
</p><p>892<br/>
00:59:56,542 --&gt; 00:59:59,773<br/>
I'm out running this "price of genius" story
to anybody who'll listen.
</p><p>893<br/>
00:59:59,945 --&gt; 01:00:04,177<br/>
And then I wake up this morning and I hear
you're calling this girl from Wisconsin...
</p><p>894<br/>
01:00:04,349 --&gt; 01:00:06,214<br/>
...messing with documents<br/>
and whatever else.
</p><p>895<br/>
01:00:06,385 --&gt; 01:00:08,910<br/>
- How can you know that?<br/>
- They're gonna take everything.
</p><p>896<br/>
01:00:09,088 --&gt; 01:00:12,580<br/>
Your partnership, your equity.<br/>
They're gonna pull your license.
</p><p>897<br/>
01:00:12,758 --&gt; 01:00:14,919<br/>
- How do you know I called Anna?<br/>
- Marty told me.
</p><p>898<br/>
01:00:15,094 --&gt; 01:00:18,860<br/>
- Well, how does he know?<br/>
- I don't know. I don't give a shit!
</p><p>899<br/>
01:00:22,568 --&gt; 01:00:24,502<br/>
- You're tapping my phone.<br/>
- Jesus, Arthur.
</p><p>900<br/>
01:00:24,670 --&gt; 01:00:26,535<br/>
Then explain it.<br/>
Tell me how Marty knows!
</p><p>901<br/>
01:00:26,705 --&gt; 01:00:31,574<br/>
Because you're chasing a girl through<br/>
a parking lot with your dick hanging out.
</p><p>902<br/>
01:00:31,743 --&gt; 01:00:34,576<br/>
You think she didn't get off the phone<br/>
and dial her attorney?
</p><p>903<br/>
01:00:34,746 --&gt; 01:00:36,611<br/>
No. She wouldn't do that. I know that.
</p><p>904<br/>
01:00:36,782 --&gt; 01:00:39,774<br/>
Really? You think your judgment<br/>
is state-of-the-art right now?
</p><p>905<br/>
01:00:41,253 --&gt; 01:00:45,553<br/>
They're putting everything on the table.
You need to stop and think this through.
</p><p>906<br/>
01:00:45,724 --&gt; 01:00:47,248<br/>
I'll help you think this through.
</p><p>907<br/>
01:00:47,426 --&gt; 01:00:49,656<br/>
I'll find somebody to help you<br/>
think it through.
</p><p>908<br/>
01:00:50,329 --&gt; 01:00:53,992<br/>
Don't do this.<br/>
You're making it easy for them.
</p><p>909<br/>
01:00:55,667 --&gt; 01:00:58,830<br/>
Michael, I have great affection for you.
</p><p>910<br/>
01:00:59,004 --&gt; 01:01:03,304<br/>
You lead a very rich and interesting life,
but you're a bagman, not an attorney.
</p><p>911<br/>
01:01:03,909 --&gt; 01:01:05,740<br/>
If you wanted to have me committed...
</p><p>912<br/>
01:01:05,911 --&gt; 01:01:09,779<br/>
...you should have kept me in Wisconsin,
where the arrest report, the videotape...
</p><p>913<br/>
01:01:09,948 --&gt; 01:01:12,610<br/>
...and eyewitness accounts<br/>
of my inappropriate behavior...
</p><p>914<br/>
01:01:12,784 --&gt; 01:01:14,752<br/>
...would have had<br/>
jurisdictional relevance.
</p><p>915<br/>
01:01:14,920 --&gt; 01:01:17,320<br/>
I have no criminal record<br/>
in the state of New York.
</p><p>916<br/>
01:01:17,756 --&gt; 01:01:23,023<br/>
And the single determining criterion<br/>
for involuntary incarceration is danger.
</p><p>917<br/>
01:01:23,195 --&gt; 01:01:26,562<br/>
Is the defendant a danger<br/>
to himself or others?
</p><p>918<br/>
01:01:26,732 --&gt; 01:01:29,428<br/>
You think you got the horses for that?
</p><p>919<br/>
01:01:29,601 --&gt; 01:01:32,331<br/>
Well, good luck and God bless.<br/>
But I tell you this:
</p><p>920<br/>
01:01:33,605 --&gt; 01:01:37,735<br/>
The last place you want to see me<br/>
is in court.
</p><p>921<br/>
01:01:38,577 --&gt; 01:01:40,408<br/>
I'm not the enemy.
</p><p>922<br/>
01:01:40,913 --&gt; 01:01:42,938<br/>
Then who are you?
</p><p>923<br/>
01:01:55,594 --&gt; 01:01:57,494<br/>
&lt;i&gt;We find the seed.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>924<br/>
01:02:01,500 --&gt; 01:02:03,593<br/>
&lt;i&gt;We shape the soil.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>925<br/>
01:02:06,505 --&gt; 01:02:08,632<br/>
&lt;i&gt;We speed the harvest.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>926<br/>
01:02:10,809 --&gt; 01:02:12,743<br/>
&lt;i&gt;We feed the planet.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>927<br/>
01:02:24,489 --&gt; 01:02:26,218<br/>
&lt;i&gt;We find the seed.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>928<br/>

</p><p>929<br/>
01:02:35,467 --&gt; 01:02:37,435<br/>
&lt;i&gt;We speed the harvest.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>930<br/>
01:02:39,638 --&gt; 01:02:40,866<br/>

</p><p>931<br/>
01:02:59,157 --&gt; 01:03:00,954<br/>
What the hell is he doing?
</p><p>932<br/>
01:03:18,510 --&gt; 01:03:20,239<br/>
&lt;i&gt;We find the seed.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>933<br/>
01:03:22,314 --&gt; 01:03:25,545<br/>
&lt;i&gt;You've reached the voicemail of<br/>

Yes!
</p><p>936<br/>
01:03:29,888 --&gt; 01:03:33,756<br/>
Here we are, all together.<br/>
Is everyone listening?
</p><p>937<br/>
01:03:33,925 --&gt; 01:03:37,361<br/>
&lt;i&gt;This is the moment you've been waiting for.

</p><p>938<br/>
01:03:37,529 --&gt; 01:03:41,056<br/>

</p><p>966<br/>
01:05:12,057 --&gt; 01:05:13,854<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... were not summarized here. "&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>967<br/>
01:05:14,025 --&gt; 01:05:15,959<br/>
Which, loosely translated, means:
</p><p>968<br/>
01:05:16,128 --&gt; 01:05:20,189<br/>
"It's going to cost a fortune to go back
on this, and I'm just an asshole in a lab...
</p><p>969<br/>
01:05:20,365 --&gt; 01:05:23,493<br/>
...so could someone else<br/>
please make the decision?"
</p><p>970<br/>
01:05:23,802 --&gt; 01:05:27,363<br/>
&lt;i&gt;"Clearly, the release of<br/>
these internal research documents...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>971<br/>
01:05:27,539 --&gt; 01:05:30,235<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... would compromise<br/>
the effective marketing of Culcitate...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>972<br/>
01:05:30,909 --&gt; 01:05:34,106<br/>
...and must be kept within<br/>
the protective confines...
</p><p>973<br/>
01:05:34,279 --&gt; 01:05:37,373<br/>
...of United-Northfield's<br/>
trade secret language."
</p><p>974<br/>
01:05:38,683 --&gt; 01:05:43,279<br/>
&lt;i&gt;You don't need me<br/>
to tell you what that means.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>975<br/>
01:05:43,555 --&gt; 01:05:44,852<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Goodbye.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>976<br/>
01:05:48,560 --&gt; 01:05:51,085<br/>
- It seemed to warrant my coming to...<br/>
- Yes.
</p><p>977<br/>
01:05:52,898 --&gt; 01:05:54,525<br/>
You have to contain this.
</p><p>978<br/>
01:05:56,268 --&gt; 01:05:58,498<br/>
- Contain?<br/>
- Right.
</p><p>979<br/>
01:05:59,037 --&gt; 01:06:01,096<br/>
Well, that's my question.
</p><p>980<br/>
01:06:01,873 --&gt; 01:06:06,207<br/>
What are the...?<br/>
What's the option that we're looking at?
</p><p>981<br/>
01:06:06,378 --&gt; 01:06:08,209<br/>
Along those lines.
</p><p>982<br/>
01:06:08,380 --&gt; 01:06:11,406<br/>
You're talking about the paper, the data?
I don't...
</p><p>983<br/>
01:06:12,317 --&gt; 01:06:16,754<br/>
Well, I'm wondering<br/>
if there is some other option.
</p><p>984<br/>
01:06:16,922 --&gt; 01:06:18,787<br/>
I mean something I'm not thinking of?
</p><p>985<br/>
01:06:19,524 --&gt; 01:06:21,492<br/>
We deal in absolutes.
</p><p>986<br/>
01:06:21,660 --&gt; 01:06:24,561<br/>
Okay. I understand that. I do.
</p><p>987<br/>
01:06:24,729 --&gt; 01:06:30,167<br/>
The material, the papers, I'm not a lawyer.
We try, we do what we can.
</p><p>988<br/>
01:06:30,335 --&gt; 01:06:32,166<br/>
Well, the other way?
</p><p>989<br/>
01:06:34,206 --&gt; 01:06:36,071<br/>
Is the other way.
</p><p>990<br/>
01:06:39,978 --&gt; 01:06:42,469<br/>
- Maybe you wanna bring Don in on this.
- No.
</p><p>991<br/>
01:06:42,647 --&gt; 01:06:46,139<br/>
This is nothing to do with Don. He's busy.
This is nothing to do with Don.
</p><p>992<br/>
01:06:53,091 --&gt; 01:06:54,888<br/>
Do you think it's doable?
</p><p>993<br/>
01:06:56,361 --&gt; 01:06:59,626<br/>
Yeah. We have some good ideas.<br/>
You say move, we move.
</p><p>994<br/>
01:06:59,798 --&gt; 01:07:02,892<br/>
If the ideas don't look so good,<br/>
we back off, reassess...
</p><p>995<br/>
01:07:03,068 --&gt; 01:07:04,399<br/>
Okay.
</p><p>996<br/>
01:07:08,440 --&gt; 01:07:11,932<br/>
Is that, "Okay, you understand,"<br/>
or "Okay, proceed"?
</p><p>997<br/>
01:07:15,680 --&gt; 01:07:18,478<br/>
Are you 1? Are you 2? Are you 3?
</p><p>998<br/>
01:07:18,650 --&gt; 01:07:21,778<br/>
Are you 4? Are you 5? Are you 6?
</p><p>999<br/>
01:07:21,953 --&gt; 01:07:24,148<br/>
- Are you 7? Are you 8? Are you 9?<br/>
- Come on.
</p><p>1000<br/>
01:07:24,322 --&gt; 01:07:26,756<br/>
Come, come on. Come on, I said. Hey!
</p><p>1001<br/>
01:07:27,626 --&gt; 01:07:29,491<br/>
Come on.
</p><p>1002<br/>
01:07:29,661 --&gt; 01:07:31,322<br/>
Go on, Dad, make a wish.
</p><p>1003<br/>
01:07:31,496 --&gt; 01:07:33,430<br/>
If I get what I wish for, it'll kill me.
</p><p>1004<br/>
01:07:34,232 --&gt; 01:07:36,894<br/>
You're a maniac. Unbelievable.
</p><p>1005<br/>
01:07:37,068 --&gt; 01:07:39,002<br/>
Give me a hand, Eddie, huh?
</p><p>1006<br/>
01:07:41,439 --&gt; 01:07:43,304<br/>
All right, Eddie.
</p><p>1007<br/>
01:07:43,475 --&gt; 01:07:46,774<br/>
Now, I did not make this myself<br/>
and I don't wanna hear any complaints.
</p><p>1008<br/>
01:07:46,945 --&gt; 01:07:48,378<br/>
Happy birthday.
</p><p>1009<br/>
01:07:48,547 --&gt; 01:07:50,310<br/>
You have time for cake?
</p><p>1010<br/>
01:07:50,815 --&gt; 01:07:53,079<br/>
Yeah, yeah. I'll take one to go.
</p><p>1011<br/>
01:07:53,251 --&gt; 01:07:54,240<br/>
You going in?
</p><p>1012<br/>
01:07:55,987 --&gt; 01:07:58,148<br/>
- I'm late already.<br/>
- Shit.
</p><p>1013<br/>
01:07:58,323 --&gt; 01:07:59,722<br/>
You're not both running out?
</p><p>1014<br/>
01:07:59,891 --&gt; 01:08:01,654<br/>
I got a situation.
</p><p>1015<br/>
01:08:01,826 --&gt; 01:08:03,487<br/>
- You can't hang?<br/>
- You're going in.
</p><p>1016<br/>
01:08:03,662 --&gt; 01:08:06,028<br/>
- Yeah. I got a shift.<br/>
- So do I.
</p><p>1017<br/>
01:08:06,197 --&gt; 01:08:09,166<br/>
Come on, man.<br/>
You haven't been up here in months.
</p><p>1018<br/>
01:08:09,334 --&gt; 01:08:12,269<br/>
If you go back now, Mickey,<br/>
Henry's staying here.
</p><p>1019<br/>
01:08:12,437 --&gt; 01:08:14,803<br/>
Good. You can drive him home.
</p><p>1020<br/>
01:08:14,973 --&gt; 01:08:16,406<br/>
Just stay for an hour.
</p><p>1021<br/>
01:08:16,975 --&gt; 01:08:18,772<br/>
The girls did all this stuff.
</p><p>1022<br/>
01:08:19,678 --&gt; 01:08:21,077<br/>
He'll be asleep by then.
</p><p>1023<br/>
01:08:24,950 --&gt; 01:08:27,043<br/>
Timmy's been calling me.
</p><p>1024<br/>
01:08:31,022 --&gt; 01:08:32,546<br/>
He's afraid to talk to you.
</p><p>1025<br/>
01:08:32,724 --&gt; 01:08:33,850<br/>
He should be.
</p><p>1026<br/>
01:08:34,025 --&gt; 01:08:36,619<br/>
- It closed out bad, right?<br/>
- Is that what he told you?
</p><p>1027<br/>
01:08:36,795 --&gt; 01:08:38,763<br/>
The kids are freaking out.
</p><p>1028<br/>
01:08:39,130 --&gt; 01:08:40,495<br/>
The in-laws are freaking out.
</p><p>1029<br/>
01:08:41,466 --&gt; 01:08:44,492<br/>
Pammy can't stop crying long enough<br/>
to start freaking out.
</p><p>1030<br/>
01:08:44,669 --&gt; 01:08:48,332<br/>
- She took him back.<br/>
- So what? Fuck her and the kids?
</p><p>1031<br/>
01:08:48,506 --&gt; 01:08:51,134<br/>
No. Fuck Timmy.<br/>
And nothing's closed, okay?
</p><p>1032<br/>
01:08:51,309 --&gt; 01:08:55,006<br/>
I sold everything and we're still short.
So don't talk about Pammy and the kids.
</p><p>1033<br/>
01:08:55,180 --&gt; 01:08:56,238<br/>
I got my hands full.
</p><p>1034<br/>
01:08:56,681 --&gt; 01:09:00,117<br/>
If it was you, he'd be in traction.
</p><p>1035<br/>
01:09:01,386 --&gt; 01:09:03,411<br/>
Yeah, he's sick, all right?
</p><p>1036<br/>
01:09:04,589 --&gt; 01:09:07,820<br/>
- He's sick. It's a sickness.<br/>
- There's a fresh perspective.
</p><p>1037<br/>
01:09:07,993 --&gt; 01:09:12,259<br/>
I've seen a lot of people falling off<br/>
the wagon lately. It's going around.
</p><p>1038<br/>
01:09:13,331 --&gt; 01:09:15,026<br/>
Is that pointed at me?
</p><p>1039<br/>
01:09:17,335 --&gt; 01:09:20,065<br/>
When do I see you?<br/>
How do I know what you're up to?
</p><p>1040<br/>
01:09:20,238 --&gt; 01:09:22,604<br/>
I haven't bet on a game in over a year.
</p><p>1041<br/>
01:09:22,774 --&gt; 01:09:25,265<br/>
I haven't been in a card room<br/>
in 10 months.
</p><p>1042<br/>
01:09:25,443 --&gt; 01:09:28,503<br/>
I gambled on the bar.<br/>
I bet on Timmy and he wiped me out.
</p><p>1043<br/>
01:09:28,680 --&gt; 01:09:30,238<br/>
That was my big play, all right?
</p><p>1044<br/>
01:09:30,415 --&gt; 01:09:34,249<br/>
I put up my walk-away money<br/>
and it's gone and I'm scrambling.
</p><p>1045<br/>
01:09:34,419 --&gt; 01:09:37,013<br/>
Okay. Okay.
</p><p>1046<br/>
01:09:38,056 --&gt; 01:09:40,024<br/>
Cool down. I hear you.
</p><p>1047<br/>
01:09:44,929 --&gt; 01:09:46,988<br/>
I'd be pissed off too.
</p><p>1048<br/>
01:09:53,271 --&gt; 01:09:54,898<br/>
Just hang for an hour.
</p><p>1049<br/>
01:09:55,807 --&gt; 01:09:57,866<br/>
- Okay?<br/>
- Yeah.
</p><p>1050<br/>
01:10:32,175 --&gt; 01:10:34,575<br/>
Ready? And, lift.
</p><p>1051<br/>
01:10:34,744 --&gt; 01:10:37,076<br/>
Ready and go.
</p><p>1052<br/>
01:11:01,037 --&gt; 01:11:02,095<br/>
Wipe.
</p><p>1053<br/>
01:11:11,280 --&gt; 01:11:13,180<br/>
You better hit it.
</p><p>1054<br/>
01:11:46,749 --&gt; 01:11:48,114<br/>
We're good.
</p><p>1055<br/>
01:12:22,451 --&gt; 01:12:25,579<br/>
Okay, I found it. That's his number.
</p><p>1056<br/>
01:12:25,755 --&gt; 01:12:27,780<br/>
Dr. Mullien.<br/>
See if you have any more luck.
</p><p>1057<br/>
01:12:27,957 --&gt; 01:12:29,891<br/>
If I can. As soon as I get a chance.
</p><p>1058<br/>
01:12:30,059 --&gt; 01:12:33,153<br/>
It's Medicaid. They're running us in circles.
I can pull the file...
</p><p>1059<br/>
01:12:33,329 --&gt; 01:12:35,194<br/>
Let him go, Steph. He's got a date.
</p><p>1060<br/>
01:12:35,364 --&gt; 01:12:37,628<br/>
I've got a date with a maniac attorney.
</p><p>1061<br/>
01:12:37,800 --&gt; 01:12:40,394<br/>
- Take a night off, Mickey.<br/>
- You look tired.
</p><p>1062<br/>
01:12:40,570 --&gt; 01:12:42,561<br/>
- I'm okay. See you soon.<br/>
- Be good.
</p><p>1063<br/>
01:12:42,738 --&gt; 01:12:44,968<br/>
- All right. Bye.<br/>
- Bye, Hen.
</p><p>1064<br/>
01:12:45,141 --&gt; 01:12:46,836<br/>
- Bye, Pop.<br/>
- Bye.
</p><p>1065<br/>
01:12:56,886 --&gt; 01:12:59,252<br/>
- Uncle Timmy, hey!<br/>
- How you doing, Henry?
</p><p>1066<br/>
01:12:59,422 --&gt; 01:13:00,753<br/>
Henry, get in the car.
</p><p>1067<br/>
01:13:03,426 --&gt; 01:13:04,859<br/>
Good to see you, Hen.
</p><p>1068<br/>
01:13:06,762 --&gt; 01:13:09,526<br/>
- What do you want?<br/>
- I've been sober eight days now.
</p><p>1069<br/>
01:13:10,533 --&gt; 01:13:14,196<br/>
Been back at the meetings.<br/>
I wanted you to know.
</p><p>1070<br/>
01:13:14,370 --&gt; 01:13:15,997<br/>
In front of the kid?
</p><p>1071<br/>
01:13:16,172 --&gt; 01:13:19,664<br/>
Mickey, please.<br/>
I know how bad I did, I swear.
</p><p>1072<br/>
01:13:20,676 --&gt; 01:13:24,271<br/>
I don't know how to make it right again.
It's all I think about.
</p><p>1073<br/>
01:13:24,780 --&gt; 01:13:27,078<br/>
What do I do? I don't know what to do.
</p><p>1074<br/>
01:13:28,184 --&gt; 01:13:30,709<br/>
Get Stephanie her tires back.
</p><p>1075<br/>
01:13:35,992 --&gt; 01:13:38,961<br/>
- Is he crying?<br/>
- I don't know.
</p><p>1076<br/>
01:13:39,128 --&gt; 01:13:40,959<br/>
Because of drugs, right?
</p><p>1077<br/>
01:13:41,130 --&gt; 01:13:42,927<br/>
That and everything else.
</p><p>1078<br/>
01:14:14,297 --&gt; 01:14:15,764<br/>
What?
</p><p>1079<br/>
01:14:18,034 --&gt; 01:14:19,399<br/>
Your Uncle Timmy...
</p><p>1080<br/>
01:14:20,069 --&gt; 01:14:25,564<br/>
...and I mean this, on his best day,<br/>
is never as tough as you.
</p><p>1081<br/>
01:14:26,609 --&gt; 01:14:29,772<br/>
I'm not talking about crying<br/>
or the drugs or anything.
</p><p>1082<br/>
01:14:29,945 --&gt; 01:14:33,039<br/>
I'm talking about in his heart, in his heart.
You understand me?
</p><p>1083<br/>
01:14:34,116 --&gt; 01:14:37,984<br/>
And all his charming bullshit,<br/>
this Big Tim, Uncle, Boss bullshit...
</p><p>1084<br/>
01:14:38,154 --&gt; 01:14:40,349<br/>
...and I know you love him,<br/>
and I know why.
</p><p>1085<br/>
01:14:40,523 --&gt; 01:14:42,320<br/>
But when you see him like that...
</p><p>1086<br/>
01:14:42,491 --&gt; 01:14:45,255<br/>
...you don't have to worry.<br/>
That's not how it'll be for you.
</p><p>1087<br/>
01:14:45,428 --&gt; 01:14:47,988<br/>
You're not gonna be someone<br/>
that goes through life...
</p><p>1088<br/>
01:14:48,164 --&gt; 01:14:51,759<br/>
...wondering why shit keeps<br/>
falling out of the sky around them.
</p><p>1089<br/>
01:14:51,934 --&gt; 01:14:54,334<br/>
I know that. I know it.
</p><p>1090<br/>
01:14:54,503 --&gt; 01:14:55,800<br/>
Okay?
</p><p>1091<br/>
01:15:00,042 --&gt; 01:15:04,206<br/>
I see it every time I look at you.<br/>
I see it right now.
</p><p>1092<br/>
01:15:06,515 --&gt; 01:15:09,245<br/>
I don't know where you got it from,<br/>
but you got it.
</p><p>1093<br/>
01:15:10,953 --&gt; 01:15:12,284<br/>
Okay?
</p><p>1094<br/>
01:15:25,501 --&gt; 01:15:26,798<br/>
Hello?
</p><p>1095<br/>
01:15:36,812 --&gt; 01:15:40,714<br/>
The neighbors came by.<br/>
They're renovating the loft downstairs.
</p><p>1096<br/>
01:15:40,883 --&gt; 01:15:45,513<br/>
They had water flooding from<br/>
his bathroom down to their place.
</p><p>1097<br/>
01:15:45,855 --&gt; 01:15:51,157<br/>
His front door, fire escape,<br/>
he had everything locked up pretty good.
</p><p>1098<br/>
01:15:51,327 --&gt; 01:15:55,661<br/>
It took our guys 10 minutes.<br/>
They had to knock the thing down.
</p><p>1099<br/>
01:15:56,665 --&gt; 01:15:59,600<br/>
There's pills all over the place.
</p><p>1100<br/>
01:16:00,403 --&gt; 01:16:05,466<br/>
Just the scene alone is<br/>
pretty definitive for suicide.
</p><p>1101<br/>
01:16:06,175 --&gt; 01:16:08,575<br/>
Then I spoke to some of your partners...
</p><p>1102<br/>
01:16:08,744 --&gt; 01:16:12,339<br/>
...who ran down these problems<br/>
he'd been having lately, so...
</p><p>1103<br/>
01:16:14,683 --&gt; 01:16:17,846<br/>
- Is there a note?<br/>
- No. They looked.
</p><p>1104<br/>
01:16:18,421 --&gt; 01:16:22,983<br/>
It could be an accident or he was gonna
write a note and just messed up.
</p><p>1105<br/>
01:16:24,059 --&gt; 01:16:25,356<br/>
Can I get in there?
</p><p>1106<br/>
01:16:25,528 --&gt; 01:16:28,554<br/>
His place? Not now. It's sealed.
</p><p>1107<br/>
01:16:29,265 --&gt; 01:16:33,429<br/>
Once the seal goes up, it's frozen.<br/>
We're gonna try and reach his daughter.
</p><p>1108<br/>
01:16:33,602 --&gt; 01:16:36,730<br/>
I guess she's off in Europe.<br/>
But she's gotta come in.
</p><p>1109<br/>
01:16:37,373 --&gt; 01:16:40,433<br/>
Or the M.E.'s gotta come back<br/>
with a toxicology report.
</p><p>1110<br/>
01:16:40,609 --&gt; 01:16:44,306<br/>
That's a couple of weeks at least<br/>
that it's gotta stay like that.
</p><p>1111<br/>
01:16:44,747 --&gt; 01:16:46,112<br/>
Sorry.
</p><p>1112<br/>
01:16:48,150 --&gt; 01:16:49,617<br/>
Sure.
</p><p>1113<br/>
01:16:55,891 --&gt; 01:16:56,880<br/>
Okay.
</p><p>1114<br/>
01:17:01,130 --&gt; 01:17:05,726<br/>
I know your brother a little.<br/>
My wife works the 190 out in Queens.
</p><p>1115<br/>
01:17:07,369 --&gt; 01:17:08,529<br/>
I'll tell him hello.
</p><p>1116<br/>
01:17:08,704 --&gt; 01:17:10,729<br/>
If something comes in,<br/>
I'll get back to you.
</p><p>1117<br/>
01:17:11,607 --&gt; 01:17:12,972<br/>
Yeah. I appreciate it.
</p><p>1118<br/>
01:17:13,142 --&gt; 01:17:14,939<br/>
I'm sorry for your loss.
</p><p>1119<br/>
01:17:33,429 --&gt; 01:17:36,023<br/>
- Michael.<br/>
- Jeff.
</p><p>1120<br/>
01:17:36,198 --&gt; 01:17:37,665<br/>
This is tough.
</p><p>1121<br/>
01:17:37,833 --&gt; 01:17:39,425<br/>
Yeah, it is. He in here?
</p><p>1122<br/>
01:17:50,980 --&gt; 01:17:53,175<br/>
Dumb son of a bitch.
</p><p>1123<br/>
01:17:53,682 --&gt; 01:17:54,808<br/>
What a thing.
</p><p>1124<br/>
01:17:54,984 --&gt; 01:17:57,214<br/>
- Hold on.<br/>
- I don't even know...
</p><p>1125<br/>
01:17:57,386 --&gt; 01:17:59,286<br/>
- I'm so sorry.<br/>
- Yeah. All right.
</p><p>1126<br/>
01:17:59,455 --&gt; 01:18:02,686<br/>
I didn't even get a chance to talk to him.
</p><p>1127<br/>
01:18:02,858 --&gt; 01:18:06,316<br/>
That crazy goddamn bastard.
</p><p>1128<br/>
01:18:06,862 --&gt; 01:18:09,854<br/>
What a waste.<br/>
What the hell was he thinking?
</p><p>1129<br/>
01:18:10,533 --&gt; 01:18:12,364<br/>
Marty? I gotta set this up.
</p><p>1130<br/>
01:18:12,535 --&gt; 01:18:14,059<br/>
Go. Go.
</p><p>1131<br/>
01:18:14,803 --&gt; 01:18:16,134<br/>
You okay?
</p><p>1132<br/>
01:18:16,872 --&gt; 01:18:18,635<br/>
Yeah, I'm fine.
</p><p>1133<br/>
01:18:19,909 --&gt; 01:18:21,968<br/>
Come on, let's get you a drink.
</p><p>1134<br/>
01:18:24,813 --&gt; 01:18:29,045<br/>
I just keep replaying all this back.<br/>
Like, did I push him too hard?
</p><p>1135<br/>
01:18:29,218 --&gt; 01:18:30,446<br/>
Not a chance.
</p><p>1136<br/>
01:18:30,619 --&gt; 01:18:32,416<br/>
I just couldn't get through to him.
</p><p>1137<br/>
01:18:32,588 --&gt; 01:18:35,751<br/>
What, you scared him to death?<br/>
Come on. The man was a bull.
</p><p>1138<br/>
01:18:36,225 --&gt; 01:18:39,854<br/>
- Never happened.<br/>
- Why does he fold, then? Why does he...?
</p><p>1139<br/>
01:18:41,897 --&gt; 01:18:43,762<br/>
It's gotta be an accident.
</p><p>1140<br/>
01:18:43,933 --&gt; 01:18:45,491<br/>
No, no. Arthur without a note?
</p><p>1141<br/>
01:18:45,668 --&gt; 01:18:48,637<br/>
He couldn't piss without leaving a memo.
Has to be an accident.
</p><p>1142<br/>
01:18:48,804 --&gt; 01:18:51,068<br/>
I don't get that.<br/>
I don't understand that either.
</p><p>1143<br/>
01:18:51,240 --&gt; 01:18:53,470<br/>
One minute he's gonna<br/>
take on the whole world...
</p><p>1144<br/>
01:18:53,642 --&gt; 01:18:56,668<br/>
...and then 12 hours later,<br/>
he's sucking down pills. Why?
</p><p>1145<br/>
01:18:56,845 --&gt; 01:18:58,244<br/>
Why?
</p><p>1146<br/>
01:18:59,682 --&gt; 01:19:02,879<br/>
Because people are<br/>
fucking incomprehensible. "Why?"
</p><p>1147<br/>
01:19:06,755 --&gt; 01:19:10,213<br/>
Thirty years I know Arthur.
</p><p>1148<br/>
01:19:10,693 --&gt; 01:19:12,354<br/>
Good years.
</p><p>1149<br/>
01:19:13,896 --&gt; 01:19:18,060<br/>
And what I feel right now, if I'm honest?
</p><p>1150<br/>
01:19:20,903 --&gt; 01:19:23,394<br/>
I can't even say, it's so awful.
</p><p>1151<br/>
01:19:24,540 --&gt; 01:19:26,201<br/>
You can say it.
</p><p>1152<br/>
01:19:28,744 --&gt; 01:19:30,644<br/>
We caught a lucky break.
</p><p>1153<br/>
01:19:33,649 --&gt; 01:19:35,947<br/>
We did, didn't we?
</p><p>1154<br/>
01:19:40,656 --&gt; 01:19:44,092<br/>
Marty? We need to get up to the office.
</p><p>1155<br/>
01:19:44,259 --&gt; 01:19:45,988<br/>
- They accepted?<br/>
- In principle.
</p><p>1156<br/>
01:19:46,161 --&gt; 01:19:48,994<br/>
Don Jeffries wants us<br/>
on the phone in half an hour.
</p><p>1157<br/>
01:19:49,164 --&gt; 01:19:52,065<br/>
I tried to explain about Arthur,<br/>
but they're short on sympathy.
</p><p>1158<br/>
01:19:52,234 --&gt; 01:19:54,134<br/>
Wait a minute. U/North is settling?
</p><p>1159<br/>
01:19:54,303 --&gt; 01:19:58,364<br/>
They see a window. They wanna try.<br/>
It's their show. What are we gonna do?
</p><p>1160<br/>
01:20:00,109 --&gt; 01:20:03,237<br/>
You did what you could, Michael.<br/>
We all did.
</p><p>1161<br/>
01:20:04,647 --&gt; 01:20:05,978<br/>
It's...
</p><p>1162<br/>
01:20:06,148 --&gt; 01:20:07,809<br/>
It's what we got.
</p><p>1163<br/>
01:20:08,951 --&gt; 01:20:11,784<br/>
- You need a ride?<br/>
- No, thanks, I'm fine.
</p><p>1164<br/>
01:20:44,586 --&gt; 01:20:45,575<br/>
Hello.
</p><p>1165<br/>
01:20:45,754 --&gt; 01:20:48,348<br/>
Hello. Hi. I'm looking for Anna Kysersun.
</p><p>1166<br/>
01:20:48,524 --&gt; 01:20:49,616<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Who is this?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1167<br/>
01:20:49,792 --&gt; 01:20:53,284<br/>
Michael Clayton. I'm an attorney in<br/>
New York. I got your number from Arthur.
</p><p>1168<br/>
01:20:53,462 --&gt; 01:20:56,329<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- You have got some nerve.<br/>
- Excuse me?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1169<br/>
01:20:56,498 --&gt; 01:21:00,298<br/>
You get her all the way to New York City
and then leave her at the airport?
</p><p>1170<br/>
01:21:00,703 --&gt; 01:21:02,295<br/>
&lt;i&gt;This is not a complicated person.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1171<br/>
01:21:02,471 --&gt; 01:21:05,304<br/>
&lt;i&gt;This is a girl who's never been<br/>
farther than Milwaukee.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1172<br/>
01:21:05,474 --&gt; 01:21:07,465<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- Wait a minute. Now, wait.<br/>
- No, you wait.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1173<br/>
01:21:07,643 --&gt; 01:21:11,875<br/>
She's coming home tomorrow<br/>
and when she does, if you call here again...
</p><p>1174<br/>
01:21:12,047 --&gt; 01:21:14,345<br/>
Are you telling me she's<br/>
in New York right now?
</p><p>1175<br/>
01:21:14,817 --&gt; 01:21:16,808<br/>
&lt;i&gt;This is a young girl, do you hear me?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1176<br/>
01:21:16,985 --&gt; 01:21:19,419<br/>
She's in the city right now?
</p><p>1177<br/>
01:21:19,588 --&gt; 01:21:21,146<br/>
&lt;i&gt;What kind of people are you?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1178<br/>
01:21:21,323 --&gt; 01:21:24,349<br/>
Listen. You just stay on the phone<br/>
one second. One second.
</p><p>1179<br/>
01:21:57,059 --&gt; 01:21:58,287<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Anna.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1180<br/>
01:22:00,696 --&gt; 01:22:02,186<br/>
Anna?
</p><p>1181<br/>
01:22:02,998 --&gt; 01:22:05,967<br/>
My name's Michael Clayton.<br/>
I'm a friend of Arthur's.
</p><p>1182<br/>
01:22:06,135 --&gt; 01:22:08,797<br/>
I spoke with your sister.<br/>
She told me you were here.
</p><p>1183<br/>
01:22:10,105 --&gt; 01:22:11,970<br/>
Please open the door, Anna.
</p><p>1184<br/>
01:22:23,285 --&gt; 01:22:24,980<br/>
What are you thinking?
</p><p>1185<br/>
01:22:25,788 --&gt; 01:22:31,090<br/>
I don't know. I'll watch the door.<br/>
You check his car. Let's get some details.
</p><p>1186<br/>
01:22:33,929 --&gt; 01:22:37,194<br/>
He didn't want to say<br/>
exactly what it was.
</p><p>1187<br/>
01:22:39,067 --&gt; 01:22:42,901<br/>
Just that when I got here,<br/>
he would pick me up...
</p><p>1188<br/>
01:22:43,071 --&gt; 01:22:45,437<br/>
...and show me, and I would see...
</p><p>1189<br/>
01:22:46,408 --&gt; 01:22:49,275<br/>
...that it was something<br/>
that would win the whole case.
</p><p>1190<br/>
01:22:52,481 --&gt; 01:22:54,346<br/>
Even this morning...
</p><p>1191<br/>
01:22:54,516 --&gt; 01:22:56,108<br/>
...I mean, I thought:
</p><p>1192<br/>
01:22:57,653 --&gt; 01:23:02,317<br/>
"Okay, if I get to the airport<br/>
and the ticket's not there, then I'll know.
</p><p>1193<br/>
01:23:02,491 --&gt; 01:23:07,588<br/>
Okay, you're stupid,<br/>
and you can go home now."
</p><p>1194<br/>
01:23:10,199 --&gt; 01:23:15,034<br/>
But it was there and he paid,<br/>
like, 800 dollars...
</p><p>1195<br/>
01:23:15,204 --&gt; 01:23:17,866<br/>
...for a first-class ticket.
</p><p>1196<br/>
01:23:18,040 --&gt; 01:23:19,507<br/>
And I just...
</p><p>1197<br/>
01:23:23,445 --&gt; 01:23:25,379<br/>
I got on the plane.
</p><p>1198<br/>
01:23:28,150 --&gt; 01:23:30,084<br/>
I believed him.
</p><p>1199<br/>
01:23:34,857 --&gt; 01:23:39,521<br/>
You think maybe he was<br/>
in some way disappointed?
</p><p>1200<br/>
01:23:40,362 --&gt; 01:23:44,355<br/>
Let's say that he knew that you<br/>
told somebody else about all of this...
</p><p>1201<br/>
01:23:44,533 --&gt; 01:23:47,969<br/>
...and, I don't know, in some crazy way,
he was disappointed by that?
</p><p>1202<br/>
01:23:49,071 --&gt; 01:23:51,972<br/>
- But I didn't.<br/>
- You must have told somebody else.
</p><p>1203<br/>
01:23:52,140 --&gt; 01:23:53,698<br/>
No.
</p><p>1204<br/>
01:23:54,877 --&gt; 01:23:57,038<br/>
He made me promise.
</p><p>1205<br/>
01:23:58,547 --&gt; 01:24:02,916<br/>
You didn't tell anybody else about this?
Not one other person?
</p><p>1206<br/>
01:24:04,052 --&gt; 01:24:05,451<br/>
No.
</p><p>1207<br/>
01:24:10,225 --&gt; 01:24:13,160<br/>
He really was crazy, wasn't he?
</p><p>1208<br/>
01:24:25,908 --&gt; 01:24:28,775<br/>
- You talking about this?<br/>
- Let me see.
</p><p>1209<br/>
01:24:30,279 --&gt; 01:24:31,940<br/>
- You know what that is?<br/>
- Yeah.
</p><p>1210<br/>
01:24:32,881 --&gt; 01:24:35,941<br/>
You said a favor.<br/>
That's more than a favor.
</p><p>1211<br/>
01:24:36,118 --&gt; 01:24:38,279<br/>
Well, nobody's gonna know<br/>
where it came from.
</p><p>1212<br/>
01:24:39,655 --&gt; 01:24:42,089<br/>
- Are you that jammed up?<br/>
- What are you talking about?
</p><p>1213<br/>
01:24:42,257 --&gt; 01:24:44,885<br/>
Who asked for this?<br/>
It's the restaurant, right?
</p><p>1214<br/>
01:24:45,060 --&gt; 01:24:47,551<br/>
One of these guys you owe?<br/>
"Get me a seal."
</p><p>1215<br/>
01:24:47,729 --&gt; 01:24:49,356<br/>
You really wanna know?
</p><p>1216<br/>
01:26:06,675 --&gt; 01:26:08,905<br/>
This just gets better and better.
</p><p>1217<br/>
01:26:10,545 --&gt; 01:26:12,137<br/>
What are we doing?
</p><p>1218<br/>
01:28:13,802 --&gt; 01:28:14,826<br/>
Freeze!
</p><p>1219<br/>
01:28:15,003 --&gt; 01:28:17,733<br/>
Right there, asshole! Don't move!
</p><p>1220<br/>
01:28:17,906 --&gt; 01:28:20,170<br/>
- It's all right, I'm a friend!<br/>
- Get your hands up!
</p><p>1221<br/>
01:28:20,342 --&gt; 01:28:22,867<br/>
Get your hands up now! Now!
</p><p>1222<br/>
01:28:23,044 --&gt; 01:28:24,978<br/>
- What's in your hand?<br/>
- It's a book.
</p><p>1223<br/>
01:28:25,147 --&gt; 01:28:28,014<br/>
Drop it! Drop it, now! Drop it!
</p><p>1224<br/>
01:28:28,183 --&gt; 01:28:31,482<br/>
- Turn around. Slowly.<br/>
- All right. All right. Okay.
</p><p>1225<br/>
01:28:31,653 --&gt; 01:28:33,484<br/>
- Who else is here?<br/>
- Nobody.
</p><p>1226<br/>
01:28:33,655 --&gt; 01:28:36,089<br/>
- I said, who else is here?<br/>
- Nobody's here!
</p><p>1227<br/>
01:28:36,258 --&gt; 01:28:37,657<br/>
Check in there.
</p><p>1228<br/>
01:28:38,460 --&gt; 01:28:41,759<br/>
You move, I'll take your head off.
</p><p>1229<br/>
01:29:11,626 --&gt; 01:29:16,063<br/>
Now I owe this scumbag and his wife...<br/>
Who's a complete piece of shit in my unit.
</p><p>1230<br/>
01:29:16,231 --&gt; 01:29:18,324<br/>
- Now I owe them both my balls.<br/>
- I'm sorry.
</p><p>1231<br/>
01:29:18,500 --&gt; 01:29:20,491<br/>
- You know I am.<br/>
- "Nobody will know it's me."
</p><p>1232<br/>
01:29:20,669 --&gt; 01:29:23,729<br/>
You know what happens they don't<br/>
bury this, that I gave you this?
</p><p>1233<br/>
01:29:23,905 --&gt; 01:29:25,270<br/>
It's bad. I know it.
</p><p>1234<br/>
01:29:25,440 --&gt; 01:29:28,500<br/>
I'm 18 months away from my 20.<br/>
You just put my pension in jeopardy.
</p><p>1235<br/>
01:29:28,677 --&gt; 01:29:30,645<br/>
- You made your point.<br/>
- It's not a point!
</p><p>1236<br/>
01:29:30,812 --&gt; 01:29:33,178<br/>
- Who called 911?<br/>
- What?
</p><p>1237<br/>
01:29:33,481 --&gt; 01:29:36,416<br/>
The building was empty. I was quiet.<br/>
I wasn't there very long.
</p><p>1238<br/>
01:29:36,585 --&gt; 01:29:39,019<br/>
Who called it in?<br/>
Does that make sense to you...?
</p><p>1239<br/>
01:29:39,187 --&gt; 01:29:40,745<br/>
This never happened.
</p><p>1240<br/>
01:29:42,057 --&gt; 01:29:44,082<br/>
You got these cops thinking<br/>
you're a lawyer.
</p><p>1241<br/>
01:29:44,259 --&gt; 01:29:46,318<br/>
You got these lawyers thinking<br/>
you're a cop.
</p><p>1242<br/>
01:29:46,494 --&gt; 01:29:50,624<br/>
You got everybody fooled, don't you?<br/>
Everybody but you.
</p><p>1243<br/>
01:29:50,799 --&gt; 01:29:52,892<br/>
You know exactly what you are.
</p><p>1244<br/>
01:30:06,514 --&gt; 01:30:08,038<br/>
We tried calling you six times.
</p><p>1245<br/>
01:30:08,216 --&gt; 01:30:10,343<br/>
But your machine must be<br/>
busted or something.
</p><p>1246<br/>
01:30:12,187 --&gt; 01:30:13,677<br/>
We gave it our best shot.
</p><p>1247<br/>
01:30:15,023 --&gt; 01:30:17,514<br/>
We ran out of red covers.<br/>
We only had 2000 in stock...
</p><p>1248<br/>
01:30:17,692 --&gt; 01:30:19,557<br/>
...so we did the other thousand in blue.
</p><p>1249<br/>
01:30:40,982 --&gt; 01:30:42,472<br/>
Is everything all right?
</p><p>1250<br/>
01:30:42,651 --&gt; 01:30:43,879<br/>
It's fine, yeah.
</p><p>1251<br/>
01:30:44,586 --&gt; 01:30:47,646<br/>
You have a van or something?<br/>
Because I have 25 boxes back there...
</p><p>1252<br/>
01:30:47,822 --&gt; 01:30:50,882<br/>
Do me a favor. Hang on to them.
</p><p>1253<br/>
01:30:51,059 --&gt; 01:30:53,289<br/>
I'll come back and pick everything up<br/>
next week.
</p><p>1254<br/>
01:30:53,461 --&gt; 01:30:55,520<br/>
- Seriously? Thanks, man.<br/>
- Yeah.
</p><p>1255<br/>
01:31:16,084 --&gt; 01:31:17,449<br/>
Hello.
</p><p>1256<br/>
01:31:22,524 --&gt; 01:31:25,823<br/>
Don. You go ahead. I'll catch up to you.
</p><p>1257<br/>
01:31:26,394 --&gt; 01:31:27,691<br/>
What?
</p><p>1258<br/>
01:31:35,103 --&gt; 01:31:37,264<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Do you know Michael Clayton?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1259<br/>
01:31:37,439 --&gt; 01:31:38,929<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Yeah, why?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1260<br/>
01:31:39,107 --&gt; 01:31:40,870<br/>
We have a situation.
</p><p>1261<br/>
01:32:00,662 --&gt; 01:32:02,220<br/>
Hey, did they find you?
</p><p>1262<br/>
01:32:02,397 --&gt; 01:32:05,423<br/>
- Who?<br/>
- Marty. I don't think they've gone in yet.
</p><p>1263<br/>
01:32:13,608 --&gt; 01:32:14,939<br/>
Marty.
</p><p>1264<br/>
01:32:15,276 --&gt; 01:32:18,473<br/>
Your phone's off. There's too much<br/>
going on for your phone to be off.
</p><p>1265<br/>
01:32:18,646 --&gt; 01:32:20,637<br/>
- I need a minute.<br/>
- Yeah, well, we're late...
</p><p>1266<br/>
01:32:20,815 --&gt; 01:32:22,442<br/>
We never got to finish last night.
</p><p>1267<br/>
01:32:22,617 --&gt; 01:32:24,744<br/>
Did you close the place?<br/>
You look like hell.
</p><p>1268<br/>
01:32:24,919 --&gt; 01:32:27,979<br/>
- No, I left right after you left.<br/>
- If you say so.
</p><p>1269<br/>
01:32:28,156 --&gt; 01:32:30,852<br/>
We've been here all night.<br/>
We had to make an announcement.
</p><p>1270<br/>
01:32:31,025 --&gt; 01:32:34,290<br/>
Jean! I need the thing, the envelope.
</p><p>1271<br/>
01:32:34,462 --&gt; 01:32:37,659<br/>
I wanted your input. I couldn't get you.
I had to pull the trigger.
</p><p>1272<br/>
01:32:37,832 --&gt; 01:32:40,767<br/>
I put Bob Nast and Kim,<br/>
probably a mistake.
</p><p>1273<br/>
01:32:40,935 --&gt; 01:32:44,268<br/>
They're gonna pull together a memorial<br/>
service by the end of the week.
</p><p>1274<br/>
01:32:44,439 --&gt; 01:32:46,703<br/>
I told them to call you<br/>
if they need any help.
</p><p>1275<br/>
01:32:47,208 --&gt; 01:32:49,972<br/>
No, no, no.<br/>
The other one. The other one.
</p><p>1276<br/>
01:32:50,545 --&gt; 01:32:52,843<br/>
So we cut you a check this morning.
</p><p>1277<br/>
01:32:53,014 --&gt; 01:32:56,313<br/>
There's some strings attached.<br/>
And Barry...
</p><p>1278<br/>
01:32:56,484 --&gt; 01:33:00,614<br/>
There's no way around this,<br/>
Barry's gonna have to be involved.
</p><p>1279<br/>
01:33:04,392 --&gt; 01:33:06,826<br/>
What if Arthur was on to something?
</p><p>1280<br/>
01:33:06,995 --&gt; 01:33:08,656<br/>
What do you mean? On to what?
</p><p>1281<br/>
01:33:08,830 --&gt; 01:33:11,697<br/>
U/North. What if he wasn't crazy?<br/>
What if he was right?
</p><p>1282<br/>
01:33:11,866 --&gt; 01:33:14,027<br/>
Right about what?<br/>
That we're on the wrong side?
</p><p>1283<br/>
01:33:14,202 --&gt; 01:33:16,636<br/>
Wrong side, wrong way,<br/>
everything, all of it.
</p><p>1284<br/>
01:33:16,805 --&gt; 01:33:19,740<br/>
This is news?<br/>
This case reeked from day one.
</p><p>1285<br/>
01:33:19,908 --&gt; 01:33:21,899<br/>
I gotta tell you how we pay the rent?
</p><p>1286<br/>
01:33:22,076 --&gt; 01:33:24,806<br/>
What would they do?<br/>
What would they do if he went public?
</p><p>1287<br/>
01:33:24,979 --&gt; 01:33:28,380<br/>
What would they do? Are you fucking soft?
They're doing it.
</p><p>1288<br/>
01:33:28,550 --&gt; 01:33:30,984<br/>
We don't straighten the settlement out<br/>
in 24 hours...
</p><p>1289<br/>
01:33:31,152 --&gt; 01:33:33,211<br/>
...they're gonna withhold<br/>
$9 million in fees.
</p><p>1290<br/>
01:33:33,388 --&gt; 01:33:36,357<br/>
Then they'll pull out the video of<br/>
Arthur doing his flashdance.
</p><p>1291<br/>
01:33:36,524 --&gt; 01:33:38,253<br/>
They'll sue us for legal malpractice.
</p><p>1292<br/>
01:33:38,426 --&gt; 01:33:42,089<br/>
Except there won't be anything to win<br/>
because the London merger will be dead...
</p><p>1293<br/>
01:33:42,263 --&gt; 01:33:44,925<br/>
...and we'll be selling off<br/>
the goddamn furniture.
</p><p>1294<br/>
01:33:45,400 --&gt; 01:33:47,095<br/>
That's 80.
</p><p>1295<br/>
01:33:47,602 --&gt; 01:33:49,399<br/>
We're calling it a bonus.
</p><p>1296<br/>
01:33:50,238 --&gt; 01:33:52,263<br/>
Three-year contract<br/>
at your current numbers.
</p><p>1297<br/>
01:33:52,440 --&gt; 01:33:54,067<br/>
That's assuming this all works out.
</p><p>1298<br/>
01:33:54,242 --&gt; 01:33:55,402<br/>
You're doing this now?
</p><p>1299<br/>
01:33:57,078 --&gt; 01:34:00,411<br/>
Look, I agreed to this, okay?<br/>
But there's rules now.
</p><p>1300<br/>
01:34:00,582 --&gt; 01:34:03,449<br/>
You want the contract,<br/>
you sign a confidentiality agreement.
</p><p>1301<br/>
01:34:03,618 --&gt; 01:34:05,711<br/>
It's gonna be bulletproof<br/>
and retroactive.
</p><p>1302<br/>
01:34:05,887 --&gt; 01:34:07,616<br/>
Because Marty's too nice to say it...
</p><p>1303<br/>
01:34:07,789 --&gt; 01:34:11,589<br/>
...but with all you know about this place,
the clients and people who work here...
</p><p>1304<br/>
01:34:11,759 --&gt; 01:34:14,319<br/>
...it makes it a little weird<br/>
when you ask for 80 grand.
</p><p>1305<br/>
01:34:14,996 --&gt; 01:34:17,692<br/>
If I was gonna shake anybody down,<br/>
I'd come to you...
</p><p>1306<br/>
01:34:17,866 --&gt; 01:34:20,528<br/>
...and it wouldn't be for 80 grand.<br/>
Is this him or you?
</p><p>1307<br/>
01:34:20,702 --&gt; 01:34:23,296<br/>
- If I'm wrong, I apologize.<br/>
- You're way the fuck wrong.
</p><p>1308<br/>
01:34:23,471 --&gt; 01:34:24,699<br/>
So there you go.
</p><p>1309<br/>
01:34:24,873 --&gt; 01:34:26,534<br/>
Enough. Okay? Everybody.
</p><p>1310<br/>
01:34:27,408 --&gt; 01:34:29,569<br/>
He's an asshole, but he knows it.
</p><p>1311<br/>
01:34:29,978 --&gt; 01:34:33,243<br/>
And you're on the record.<br/>
Okay? Everybody happy?
</p><p>1312<br/>
01:34:33,882 --&gt; 01:34:36,578<br/>
- Don Jeffries is here.<br/>
- We're on the way.
</p><p>1313<br/>
01:34:37,385 --&gt; 01:34:41,481<br/>
Call Bob Nast.<br/>
Just see if they need help with this thing.
</p><p>1314<br/>
01:34:45,059 --&gt; 01:34:46,424<br/>
You're welcome.
</p><p>1315<br/>
01:35:39,314 --&gt; 01:35:41,680<br/>
You said 12. This is 75.
</p><p>1316<br/>
01:35:41,849 --&gt; 01:35:44,010<br/>
Well, don't get too excited.<br/>
You want a drink?
</p><p>1317<br/>
01:35:44,185 --&gt; 01:35:46,050<br/>
No. I'm working.
</p><p>1318<br/>
01:35:48,489 --&gt; 01:35:52,016<br/>
So we're square, then. No bad blood.
</p><p>1319<br/>
01:35:52,193 --&gt; 01:35:53,888<br/>
You're just doing your job.
</p><p>1320<br/>
01:35:54,062 --&gt; 01:35:55,529<br/>
That's right.
</p><p>1321<br/>
01:35:56,464 --&gt; 01:35:58,193<br/>
Take it easy, Gabe.
</p><p>1322<br/>
01:35:59,200 --&gt; 01:36:00,565<br/>
Michael.
</p><p>1323<br/>
01:36:12,313 --&gt; 01:36:13,746<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Check.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1324<br/>
01:36:15,583 --&gt; 01:36:16,845<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Check.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1325<br/>
01:36:17,185 --&gt; 01:36:19,915<br/>
- Check.<br/>
- Half the pot. Two hundred.
</p><p>1326<br/>
01:36:20,088 --&gt; 01:36:21,385<br/>
Two hundred to go.
</p><p>1327<br/>
01:36:58,760 --&gt; 01:37:00,523<br/>
So, what happened with the bar?
</p><p>1328<br/>
01:37:00,695 --&gt; 01:37:02,720<br/>
You just had to be a rock star, huh?
</p><p>1329<br/>
01:37:25,219 --&gt; 01:37:27,983<br/>
What are you doing? You just got here.
</p><p>1330<br/>
01:37:28,156 --&gt; 01:37:30,090<br/>
Guy plays nine hands, walks away.
</p><p>1331<br/>
01:37:30,258 --&gt; 01:37:34,422<br/>
I scare you away? What did I do?<br/>
Did I scare you away?
</p><p>1332<br/>
01:38:10,198 --&gt; 01:38:11,256<br/>
Get out.
</p><p>1333<br/>
01:38:12,633 --&gt; 01:38:14,760<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Get out of the car now.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1334<br/>
01:38:16,504 --&gt; 01:38:17,493<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- Walter?<br/>
- Michael.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1335<br/>
01:38:17,672 --&gt; 01:38:19,867<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- Michael. Thank God you're there.<br/>
- Yeah.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1336<br/>
01:38:24,278 --&gt; 01:38:26,212<br/>
You have eight...
</p><p>1337<br/>
01:38:27,115 --&gt; 01:38:29,845<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... six, five...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1338<br/>
01:38:30,017 --&gt; 01:38:32,349<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... four, three...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1339<br/>
01:38:32,520 --&gt; 01:38:34,147<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Get out of the car.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1340<br/>
01:38:37,592 --&gt; 01:38:40,618<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- Tell him to stay off the phone.<br/>
- All right. But you're on it?&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1341<br/>
01:38:41,229 --&gt; 01:38:42,662<br/>
Am I clean?
</p><p>1342<br/>
01:38:42,830 --&gt; 01:38:44,058<br/>
Just keep walking.
</p><p>1343<br/>
01:38:44,232 --&gt; 01:38:46,462<br/>
You copy. Am I clean?
</p><p>1344<br/>
01:38:46,667 --&gt; 01:38:49,659<br/>
Just keep moving.<br/>
He's walking to the car.
</p><p>1345<br/>
01:38:50,204 --&gt; 01:38:53,765<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- to let him know you're on the way.
I'll get back to you with the details.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1346<br/>
01:38:53,941 --&gt; 01:38:56,375<br/>
&lt;i&gt;- Just give me two minutes.<br/>
- I'll be in the car.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1347<br/>
01:39:00,081 --&gt; 01:39:03,517<br/>
&lt;i&gt;I didn't finish. It's in, but I don't know.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1348<br/>
01:39:31,679 --&gt; 01:39:35,240<br/>
It's loose. I got a pulse.<br/>
He's up there somewhere, but...
</p><p>1349<br/>
01:39:37,018 --&gt; 01:39:38,952<br/>
Let's find a way to boost the signal.
</p><p>1350<br/>
01:39:46,527 --&gt; 01:39:49,724<br/>
- I don't know what Walter promised you...
- A miracle worker!
</p><p>1351<br/>
01:39:49,897 --&gt; 01:39:53,128<br/>
That's Walter on the phone,<br/>
20 minutes ago. Direct quote, okay?
</p><p>1352<br/>
01:39:53,301 --&gt; 01:39:55,132<br/>
"I'm sending you a miracle worker."
</p><p>1353<br/>
01:39:55,303 --&gt; 01:39:56,964<br/>
- Well, he misspoke.<br/>
- About what?
</p><p>1354<br/>
01:39:57,138 --&gt; 01:40:00,665<br/>
About the fact that you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're any good at it?
</p><p>1355<br/>
01:40:06,447 --&gt; 01:40:08,381<br/>
We're up. Just got a signal.
</p><p>1356<br/>
01:40:32,240 --&gt; 01:40:34,606<br/>
There's nothing back this way.<br/>
What's he doing?
</p><p>1357<br/>
01:40:34,775 --&gt; 01:40:35,969<br/>
Maybe he's lost.
</p><p>1358<br/>
01:40:36,143 --&gt; 01:40:37,940<br/>
- Wait a minute.<br/>
- That's him.
</p><p>1359<br/>
01:40:41,282 --&gt; 01:40:42,510<br/>
He was alone, right?
</p><p>1360<br/>
01:40:42,683 --&gt; 01:40:45,481<br/>
- Yeah, I think so.<br/>
- Call it, yes or no?
</p><p>1361<br/>
01:40:47,922 --&gt; 01:40:49,549<br/>
We gotta turn around.
</p><p>1362<br/>
01:41:19,787 --&gt; 01:41:21,414<br/>
Talk to me.
</p><p>1363<br/>
01:41:21,589 --&gt; 01:41:23,147<br/>
It's strobing.
</p><p>1364<br/>
01:41:23,324 --&gt; 01:41:25,724<br/>
No, we're good. I think we're good.<br/>
Just keep going.
</p><p>1365<br/>
01:41:41,542 --&gt; 01:41:43,134<br/>
No, he turned. Somehow he turned.
</p><p>1366<br/>
01:41:43,311 --&gt; 01:41:44,676<br/>
- Where?<br/>
- He took...
</p><p>1367<br/>
01:41:45,179 --&gt; 01:41:47,147<br/>
- He took a left.<br/>
- I don't have a left.
</p><p>1368<br/>
01:41:57,124 --&gt; 01:42:00,059<br/>
- East. He's southeast.<br/>
- What, so we missed it?
</p><p>1369<br/>
01:42:00,227 --&gt; 01:42:02,354<br/>
- Or the grid is wrong.<br/>
- Hang on.
</p><p>1370<br/>
01:42:12,540 --&gt; 01:42:15,236<br/>
- We gotta go back to one.<br/>
- One is what? Where's our one?
</p><p>1371<br/>
01:42:15,443 --&gt; 01:42:18,435<br/>
Half a mile straight ahead.<br/>
Just keep driving. Just go.
</p><p>1372<br/>
01:42:25,319 --&gt; 01:42:27,947<br/>
It says we're closing.<br/>
But that's west. It can't be west.
</p><p>1373<br/>
01:42:28,122 --&gt; 01:42:29,180<br/>
The signal or the grid?
</p><p>1374<br/>
01:42:29,357 --&gt; 01:42:32,087<br/>
- It's both. It just keeps dropping out.
- Goddamn it.
</p><p>1375<br/>
01:43:23,310 --&gt; 01:43:24,777<br/>
Give me the cell.
</p><p>1376<br/>
01:43:27,314 --&gt; 01:43:29,009<br/>
Our signal's good.
</p><p>1377<br/>
01:45:06,914 --&gt; 01:45:08,176<br/>
What?
</p><p>1378<br/>
01:45:10,818 --&gt; 01:45:12,513<br/>
Thanks, Mickey.
</p><p>1379<br/>
01:45:12,686 --&gt; 01:45:14,347<br/>
Just get me out of here.
</p><p>1380<br/>
01:45:22,062 --&gt; 01:45:25,793<br/>
I wanna get a meeting scheduled on this,
soon as we can. Thursday at the latest.
</p><p>1381<br/>
01:45:25,966 --&gt; 01:45:29,595<br/>
I think we should have someone from<br/>
the equity group there. Maybe McDonnell...
</p><p>1382<br/>
01:45:29,770 --&gt; 01:45:31,260<br/>
- Yeah?<br/>
- Did you hear?
</p><p>1383<br/>
01:45:31,438 --&gt; 01:45:33,963<br/>
- Yeah, yeah. They closed U/North.<br/>
- No. Michael Clayton.
</p><p>1384<br/>
01:45:34,408 --&gt; 01:45:35,466<br/>
What?
</p><p>1385<br/>
01:45:35,643 --&gt; 01:45:38,544<br/>
Car bomb. Upstate. This morning.<br/>
He was killed.
</p><p>1386<br/>
01:45:39,580 --&gt; 01:45:40,604<br/>
What?
</p><p>1387<br/>
01:45:42,283 --&gt; 01:45:44,114<br/>
Holy shit.
</p><p>1388<br/>
01:45:58,299 --&gt; 01:46:03,236<br/>
&lt;i&gt;It has been and it remains<br/>
the U/North position...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1389<br/>
01:46:03,404 --&gt; 01:46:07,500<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... that this lawsuit is baseless<br/>
and without merit.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1390<br/>
01:46:07,675 --&gt; 01:46:11,736<br/>
Our reluctance to negotiate<br/>
was anchored by this belief...
</p><p>1391<br/>
01:46:11,912 --&gt; 01:46:17,077<br/>
...and reinforced by the plaintiffs' demand
for settlement...
</p><p>1392<br/>
01:46:17,251 --&gt; 01:46:19,811<br/>
...in excess of 3 billion dollars.
</p><p>1393<br/>
01:46:19,987 --&gt; 01:46:23,445<br/>
The reason that we are<br/>
all here today is...
</p><p>1394<br/>
01:46:23,624 --&gt; 01:46:27,492<br/>
...that several key elements<br/>
in the case have changed.
</p><p>1395<br/>
01:46:28,495 --&gt; 01:46:32,932<br/>
&lt;i&gt;You all have<br/>
a tentative proposal packet...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1396<br/>
01:46:33,534 --&gt; 01:46:37,493<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... which outlines the details,<br/>
but the bottom line is this:&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1397<br/>
01:46:37,671 --&gt; 01:46:40,435<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Over the past several months<br/>
we had gotten word...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1398<br/>
01:46:40,608 --&gt; 01:46:43,941<br/>
...that the plaintiffs were<br/>
growing impatient...
</p><p>1399<br/>
01:46:44,111 --&gt; 01:46:47,945<br/>
...and were in the process<br/>
of revising their settlement numbers.
</p><p>1400<br/>
01:46:48,449 --&gt; 01:46:49,916<br/>
&lt;i&gt;We also learned...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1401<br/>
01:46:50,084 --&gt; 01:46:54,020<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... that the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees
were capped at 32 percent...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1402<br/>
01:46:54,188 --&gt; 01:46:56,281<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... up to 400 million dollars...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1403<br/>
01:46:56,724 --&gt; 01:47:00,956<br/>
...above which,<br/>
their fees dropped to 24 percent.
</p><p>1404<br/>
01:47:01,128 --&gt; 01:47:05,690<br/>
So we knew that there would be<br/>
this motivational dead zone for them...
</p><p>1405<br/>
01:47:05,866 --&gt; 01:47:07,197<br/>
...in the middle there.
</p><p>1406<br/>
01:47:07,968 --&gt; 01:47:09,663<br/>
&lt;i&gt;Finally...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1407<br/>
01:47:09,837 --&gt; 01:47:14,171<br/>
...our finance team informed us<br/>
that they had run the numbers...
</p><p>1408<br/>
01:47:14,341 --&gt; 01:47:16,172<br/>
...and that the tax benefit...
</p><p>1409<br/>
01:47:16,343 --&gt; 01:47:19,574<br/>
...provided that we bring<br/>
the settlement in under 600 million...
</p><p>1410<br/>
01:47:19,747 --&gt; 01:47:22,181<br/>
...and within this fiscal year...
</p><p>1411<br/>
01:47:22,349 --&gt; 01:47:28,219<br/>
...that the write-off on this settlement
would essentially pay for itself.
</p><p>1412<br/>
01:47:28,722 --&gt; 01:47:32,920<br/>
&lt;i&gt;The package that you have before you
represents, in my judgment...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1413<br/>
01:47:33,360 --&gt; 01:47:38,161<br/>
&lt;i&gt;... the strongest possible position for
our company under the circumstances.&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1414<br/>
01:47:38,332 --&gt; 01:47:40,027<br/>
&lt;i&gt;And, as chief counsel...&lt;/i&gt;
</p><p>1415<br/>
01:47:40,200 --&gt; 01:47:43,465<br/>
...it is my recommendation<br/>
that this proposal be confirmed.
</p><p>1416<br/>
01:47:44,538 --&gt; 01:47:48,065<br/>
Thank you, Karen. If you just give us<br/>
a few minutes to talk about it.
</p><p>1417<br/>
01:47:48,242 --&gt; 01:47:50,506<br/>
Certainly. I'll be right outside.
</p><p>1418<br/>
01:47:52,913 --&gt; 01:47:53,902<br/>
Well...
</p><p>1419<br/>
01:48:17,037 --&gt; 01:48:18,868<br/>
How'd it go in there?
</p><p>1420<br/>
01:48:21,909 --&gt; 01:48:24,104<br/>
Pretty freaky, huh?
</p><p>1421<br/>
01:48:24,278 --&gt; 01:48:27,247<br/>
Did you see Arthur?<br/>
He's wandering around here somewhere.
</p><p>1422<br/>
01:48:29,783 --&gt; 01:48:33,048<br/>
I'm kidding. Lighten up.
</p><p>1423<br/>
01:48:34,621 --&gt; 01:48:38,318<br/>
You got one of these? It's a great memo.
It's an oldie but a goodie.
</p><p>1424<br/>
01:48:41,495 --&gt; 01:48:42,962<br/>
Got your heart racing, don't I?
</p><p>1425<br/>
01:48:43,130 --&gt; 01:48:45,257<br/>
I don't know what it is<br/>
you think you're doing.
</p><p>1426<br/>
01:48:45,432 --&gt; 01:48:46,797<br/>
What do you think I'm doing?
</p><p>1427<br/>
01:48:46,967 --&gt; 01:48:48,764<br/>
The suit's over. We have a deal.
</p><p>1428<br/>
01:48:48,936 --&gt; 01:48:51,632<br/>
Whatever that is,<br/>
it's meaningless at this point.
</p><p>1429<br/>
01:48:51,805 --&gt; 01:48:55,468<br/>
You think? I must have gotten it wrong.
I thought you had a tentative proposal.
</p><p>1430<br/>
01:48:55,642 --&gt; 01:48:57,837<br/>
I didn't realize you'd signed<br/>
all those checks.
</p><p>1431<br/>
01:48:58,011 --&gt; 01:49:01,310<br/>
That's a drag. I got a thousand of these.
What am I gonna do with them?
</p><p>1432<br/>
01:49:01,482 --&gt; 01:49:02,813<br/>
I'm calling Marty.
</p><p>1433<br/>
01:49:02,983 --&gt; 01:49:05,349<br/>
Good. Good. Do it.<br/>
That's a great place to start.
</p><p>1434<br/>
01:49:05,519 --&gt; 01:49:08,317<br/>
Let's find out who told him<br/>
Arthur was calling Anna Kysersun.
</p><p>1435<br/>
01:49:08,489 --&gt; 01:49:10,320<br/>
Let's find out who tapped those phones.
</p><p>1436<br/>
01:49:10,491 --&gt; 01:49:14,291<br/>
This memorandum, even if it's authentic,
which I doubt, I highly doubt...
</p><p>1437<br/>
01:49:14,461 --&gt; 01:49:17,897<br/>
- I know what you did to Arthur.<br/>
- It's protected. It belongs to U/North.
</p><p>1438<br/>
01:49:18,065 --&gt; 01:49:20,829<br/>
- I know you killed him.<br/>
- It's attorney-client privilege.
</p><p>1439<br/>
01:49:21,001 --&gt; 01:49:24,664<br/>
See, now, that's just not<br/>
the way to go here, Karen.
</p><p>1440<br/>
01:49:24,838 --&gt; 01:49:27,534<br/>
For such a smart person,<br/>
you really are lost, aren't you?
</p><p>1441<br/>
01:49:27,708 --&gt; 01:49:29,039<br/>
This conversation is over.
</p><p>1442<br/>
01:49:29,209 --&gt; 01:49:32,645<br/>
I'm not the guy that you kill.<br/>
I'm the guy that you buy.
</p><p>1443<br/>
01:49:32,813 --&gt; 01:49:35,338<br/>
Are you so fucking blind<br/>
you don't even see what I am?
</p><p>1444<br/>
01:49:35,516 --&gt; 01:49:39,008<br/>
I'm the easiest part of your whole<br/>
goddamn problem and you're gonna kill me?
</p><p>1445<br/>
01:49:39,319 --&gt; 01:49:42,447<br/>
Don't you know who I am?<br/>
I'm a fixer. I'm a bagman.
</p><p>1446<br/>
01:49:42,623 --&gt; 01:49:46,024<br/>
I do everything from shoplifting housewives
to bent congressmen...
</p><p>1447<br/>
01:49:46,193 --&gt; 01:49:48,093<br/>
...and you're gonna kill me?
</p><p>1448<br/>
01:49:49,029 --&gt; 01:49:51,862<br/>
What do you need, Karen? Lay it on me.
</p><p>1449<br/>
01:49:52,032 --&gt; 01:49:55,729<br/>
You want a carry permit? You want<br/>
a heads-up on an insider-trading subpoena?
</p><p>1450<br/>
01:49:55,903 --&gt; 01:49:59,737<br/>
I sold out Arthur for 80 grand<br/>
and a contract and you're gonna kill me?
</p><p>1451<br/>
01:50:01,241 --&gt; 01:50:02,674<br/>
What do you want?
</p><p>1452<br/>
01:50:02,843 --&gt; 01:50:04,367<br/>
What do I want?
</p><p>1453<br/>
01:50:04,545 --&gt; 01:50:06,137<br/>
I want more.
</p><p>1454<br/>
01:50:06,647 --&gt; 01:50:08,410<br/>
I want out.
</p><p>1455<br/>
01:50:08,582 --&gt; 01:50:11,210<br/>
And with this, I want everything.
</p><p>1456<br/>
01:50:12,986 --&gt; 01:50:14,214<br/>
Is there a number?
</p><p>1457<br/>
01:50:14,388 --&gt; 01:50:15,980<br/>
Ten is a number.
</p><p>1458<br/>
01:50:16,156 --&gt; 01:50:18,181<br/>
Ten? Ten what?
</p><p>1459<br/>
01:50:20,227 --&gt; 01:50:21,717<br/>
Ten million?
</p><p>1460<br/>
01:50:21,895 --&gt; 01:50:25,331<br/>
Where do you think I'm gonna get<br/>
10 million dollars?
</p><p>1461<br/>
01:50:25,899 --&gt; 01:50:27,799<br/>
You know what's great about this?
</p><p>1462<br/>
01:50:27,968 --&gt; 01:50:30,266<br/>
Did you read it to the end?<br/>
You see who signed it?
</p><p>1463<br/>
01:50:30,838 --&gt; 01:50:32,738<br/>
Let's go in and ask Don Jeffries...
</p><p>1464<br/>
01:50:32,906 --&gt; 01:50:35,898<br/>
...if he wants to pass the hat<br/>
for a worthy cause.
</p><p>1465<br/>
01:50:37,744 --&gt; 01:50:40,144<br/>
This would have to be<br/>
a longer conversation...
</p><p>1466<br/>
01:50:40,314 --&gt; 01:50:42,441<br/>
...and would have to take place<br/>
somewhere else.
</p><p>1467<br/>
01:50:42,616 --&gt; 01:50:44,106<br/>
Where? My car?
</p><p>1468<br/>
01:50:45,686 --&gt; 01:50:46,710<br/>
All right.
</p><p>1469<br/>
01:50:47,888 --&gt; 01:50:50,914<br/>
I'm gonna make it easy. Let's make it 5.
</p><p>1470<br/>
01:50:51,091 --&gt; 01:50:52,888<br/>
Five and I'll forget about Arthur.
</p><p>1471<br/>
01:50:55,262 --&gt; 01:51:00,029<br/>
Five is easier. Yeah, 5 is something<br/>
that we could talk about.
</p><p>1472<br/>
01:51:00,200 --&gt; 01:51:03,931<br/>
Good. And then the other 5 is<br/>
to forget about the 468 people...
</p><p>1473<br/>
01:51:04,104 --&gt; 01:51:06,197<br/>
...that you knocked off<br/>
with your weed killer.
</p><p>1474<br/>
01:51:06,373 --&gt; 01:51:08,739<br/>
Let me finish up this meeting.<br/>
I'll talk to Don...
</p><p>1475<br/>
01:51:08,909 --&gt; 01:51:11,503<br/>
Do I look like I'm negotiating?!
</p><p>1476<br/>
01:51:11,678 --&gt; 01:51:13,009<br/>
Karen?
</p><p>1477<br/>
01:51:13,714 --&gt; 01:51:15,579<br/>
- One second.<br/>
- Everything okay?
</p><p>1478<br/>
01:51:16,950 --&gt; 01:51:17,939<br/>
Yes.
</p><p>1479<br/>
01:51:18,952 --&gt; 01:51:22,752<br/>
Ten million dollars. Bank of my choosing.
Offshore. Immediately.
</p><p>1480<br/>
01:51:22,923 --&gt; 01:51:24,049<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
- Say it!
</p><p>1481<br/>
01:51:24,224 --&gt; 01:51:28,092<br/>
Ten million dollars, your account,<br/>
the moment this meeting is through.
</p><p>1482<br/>
01:51:28,262 --&gt; 01:51:30,560<br/>
- Karen! Everyone's waiting.<br/>
- I'm coming, Don.
</p><p>1483<br/>
01:51:31,598 --&gt; 01:51:32,963<br/>
You have a deal.
</p><p>1484<br/>
01:51:33,534 --&gt; 01:51:34,796<br/>
You're so fucked.
</p><p>1485<br/>
01:51:35,135 --&gt; 01:51:36,466<br/>
What?
</p><p>1486<br/>
01:51:36,970 --&gt; 01:51:38,835<br/>
- You're fucked.<br/>
- What do you mean?
</p><p>1487<br/>
01:51:39,006 --&gt; 01:51:41,236<br/>
- Take a wild guess.<br/>
- Is there a problem?
</p><p>1488<br/>
01:51:41,408 --&gt; 01:51:44,104<br/>
- I don't understand.<br/>
- Let me get a picture while I'm at it.
</p><p>1489<br/>
01:51:44,278 --&gt; 01:51:47,076<br/>
- You don't want the money?<br/>
- Keep the money. You'll need it.
</p><p>1490<br/>
01:51:47,247 --&gt; 01:51:48,839<br/>
Is this fellow bothering you?
</p><p>1491<br/>
01:51:49,016 --&gt; 01:51:50,244<br/>
Am I bothering you?
</p><p>1492<br/>
01:51:50,417 --&gt; 01:51:54,444<br/>
Karen, I've got a board waiting in there.
What the hell's going on? Who are you?
</p><p>1493<br/>
01:51:54,621 --&gt; 01:51:56,316<br/>
I'm Shiva, the god of death.
</p><p>1494<br/>
01:51:56,490 --&gt; 01:52:00,119<br/>
Ron! Ronny, I need security<br/>
out here immediately.
</p><p>1495<br/>
01:52:01,028 --&gt; 01:52:02,290<br/>
All right. Here we go.
</p><p>1496<br/>
01:52:02,462 --&gt; 01:52:05,659<br/>
That guy right there, stop him.<br/>
Grab that guy.
</p><p>1497<br/>
01:52:07,267 --&gt; 01:52:09,997<br/>
- What are you doing?<br/>
- We're detectives with the N.Y.P.D.
</p><p>1498<br/>
01:52:10,170 --&gt; 01:52:12,502<br/>
Come back with us<br/>
and we'll explain everything.
</p><p>1499<br/>
01:52:12,673 --&gt; 01:52:15,938<br/>
Check on her. Make sure she doesn't need
any medical attention.
</p><p>1500<br/>
01:52:16,109 --&gt; 01:52:18,270<br/>
You guys go into the ballroom.<br/>
Nobody leaves.
</p><p>1501<br/>
01:52:18,445 --&gt; 01:52:20,208<br/>
Have your guys cover every exit.
</p><p>1502<br/>
01:52:20,380 --&gt; 01:52:23,178<br/>
Will you please explain to me<br/>
what's going on here?
</p><p>1503<br/>
01:52:23,817 --&gt; 01:52:25,182<br/>
Did you get all that?
</p><p>1504<br/>
01:52:25,352 --&gt; 01:52:27,547<br/>
Yeah. Got it.
</p><p>1505<br/>
01:52:31,191 --&gt; 01:52:34,024<br/>
- You okay?<br/>
- Yeah. Just gotta get some air.
</p><p>1506<br/>
01:52:34,194 --&gt; 01:52:35,684<br/>
Sure.
</p><p>1507<br/>
01:52:36,063 --&gt; 01:52:38,827<br/>
Just stay close, okay?
</p><p>1508<br/>
01:52:38,999 --&gt; 01:52:40,227<br/>
Okay.
</p><p>1509<br/>
01:53:50,871 --&gt; 01:53:52,702<br/>
So, what are we doing?
</p><p>1510<br/>
01:53:59,780 --&gt; 01:54:01,771<br/>
Give me 50 dollars' worth.
</p><p>1511<br/>
01:54:03,650 --&gt; 01:54:05,311<br/>
Just drive.
